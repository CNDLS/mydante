	 The pedagogy of "MyDante" rests on the conviction that web based digital technology offers us the possibility of re-creating in a contemporary form one of the most powerful and effective technologies of contemplative writing and reading ever developed by human culture: the illuminated manuscript.<br />
	 <br />
	 The medieval monastic tradition created a culture and lifestyle all the parts of which were  pedagogically integrated around its central purpose and activity:  contemplation. As part of that tradition, the monks developed practices of active imaginative engagement with the texts of Scripture which were the subject of their contemplation, ranging from meticulous manual copying and  editing to artistic illustration and scholarly commentary. In the manuscripts the monks produced, we can clearly discern how closely connected technology, action and contemplation always are in the fabric of a human way of life. The illuminated manuscript was not simply the product of a sophisticated technology. Its use embodied the  practice of a distinct pedagogical method of educating the members of the  monastic community toward the goal of realizing the personal vocation to which  each was called individually, according to the pattern of Jesus set forth in  the Gospels.<br />
	 <br />
	 What is most important to recognize is that the technology of the illuminated manuscript did not have its origin in a detached academic, scholarly, or purely intellectual concern for the text being read. Rather, the illuminated manuscript developed from a concern to enter into a profound personal dialogue with the meaning of the text. This conversation sought to go beyond understanding to reach an experience of truth which became part of the reader's own being.   Contemplation, a tradition handed down from the Greeks and integrated into Christian culture, means a kind of human conscious engagement with truth that is attained only after the reader has employed every human means possible to imagine the profound depths of meaning which the text contains virtually within itself. Contemplation was not act of the mind alone, but of the whole person: body and soul, mind and heart; it was an experience not of some part of reality but of reality as a whole, virtually present <em>in</em>, and <em>through</em> and <em>as</em> the relationship of reader and text. And finally, as a form of  prayer, this relationship was experienced as one occurring between persons. <br />
	 <br />
	 Understood in this way, the experience of contemplative reading is a path of access to the virtual reality of realms of truth contained within the text that only the human imagination can reach. The term "contemplative reading" as it is being used here designates a process of holistic personal appropriation of the truth of a text which is regarded as "sacred scripture," a text which addresses the reader with the authority of divine inspiration. In other words, the  pedagogy of "My Dante" is based on the conviction that Dante wrote his poem and expected its hearer\readers to understand it not simply as writing, but as  Scripture. That conviction rests on the method which Dante himself stipulates for reading his poem with understanding in his "Letter to Can Grande della  Scala," the method of allegorical interpretation which was developed by the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions to read faithfully the Scripture which each held to be the gift of divine revelation.<br />
	 <br />
	 Dante came to  believe that it was his vocation to write an epic poem which at the same time would also be a personal gospel bearing witness to the saving grace of God in his life and to do so in a language and style that uniquely suited to his time and place. As a "gospel" the poem demands that it be read contemplatively so as to be appropriated personally. "My Dante" re-creates today in digital form the technology of reading and writing that guided and informed the monastic contemplative tradition in the production and use of the illuminated manuscript  as a means of undertaking the journey to which the poem invites us, a journey of contemplative self-discovery which would end, as it did for Dante, with a visionary experience of the divine in the human and the human in the divine beyond the limits of what either the language of the living or the silence of the death could express.<br />
	 <br />
	 What must a reader do in order to experience the poem contemplatively? How does reading as  a contemplative practice work? The first requirement is to recognize that, just as Dante told his patron, Can Grande della Scala of Verona, there are multiple levels of meaning simultaneously at work in the poem, each of which requires a different kind of understanding; the second requirement is to learn how to move progressively <strong>from</strong>:<br />
	 <br />
	 -The <strong>literal, narrative level</strong>, contained in the story of <strong>Dante the pilgrim </strong>as his journey begins in the Dark Wood until it ends in the Final Vision. The goal of reading at this first level is clear <strong>comprehension </strong>of the main characters and events which form the plot  of the poem's narrative. In other words, understanding at this level means  asking the question, "Who is Dante the pilgrim?"</p>
	<p>-The<strong> ironic and metaphoric level</strong> contained in and communicated by the artistic choices <strong>Dante the poet </strong>makes<strong> </strong>regarding characters, episodes, images and themes at the narrative level. For example, in Inf.26, we ask, "So, why does the poet choose to have the pilgrim  meet Ulysses? Why here? Why this story of the end of his life, when the story of the Trojan horse is much more famous? Why is he punished together with Diomedes in a tongue of fire?" By recognizing these as choices, the reader becomes aware that, ironically, Dante the pilgrim both is and is not "really" the same person as Dante the poet, and that, as metaphor, the narrative  necessarily both reveals and conceals the truth of which Dante intends the poem to be a "confession" (modeled on <em>The  Confessions</em> of St. Augustine) and to which it is a witness or testimony in  the form of a gospel. The goal of  understanding at this level is to arrive at an <strong>interpretation</strong> of the message the poet is addressing to the reader in the conviction that it is his responsibility to do so. This is to ask, What  is the meaning and significance of the "good news" as Dante has testified toit? or in other words, to explore the question, as best one can within the  limits of the text, Who is Dante the poet? What is he trying so hard to tell me?</p>
	<p>-The <strong>reflective level</strong>, contained in the <strong>reader's personal responses </strong>to  the poet's confession, witness and testimony, in the form of a kind of dialogue between the poet and the reader. The goal of this level of understanding is <strong>personal</strong> <strong>reflection. </strong>The meaning of the poem is not finally understood until reader and poet find themselves standing face to face, in the presence of all  the others who face the same universal human questions of personal identity,  freedom and responsibility. To do this requires a movement of imagination on the part of the reader worthy of the one  that the poet has made in writing the text. It requires imagining how one's own  journey is the same as the poet's, how both are "universal," the same for all  persons, despite every difference of time, place and culture. To understand the poem is to become part of the poem by recognizing oneself in the poem and making the poem genuinely one's own by responding to the question, "Who am I?" not simply as an individual, but as a person who is both genuinely the same as  and singularly different from every other person in such a way that, as the  poem tells us from the beginning, the story it recounts is truly the story of "our life."</p>
	<p>Through the universality of its metaphors, The <em>Commedia</em> addresses  human experiences that occur in the lives of all human beings, which occur  precisely &quot;<em>nel mezzo del cammin di  nostra vita</em>." In order to understand Dante's poetic metaphors, each reader  must participate in them personally and in a way which is genuinely contemplative. This contemplative reading goes beyond the literal meaning, and even beyond the traditional allegorical or interpreted meaning, to apply every possibility of meaning contained in the text to the reader's own life and identity. Contemplative reading means dialogue with the text in a way that engages the whole person of the reader  with the realities of which the text speaks. Thus the meaning of the poem as a whole pertains to human freedom and responsibility, so that its meaning cannot be understood except in so far as the reader takes that freedom and responsibility upon him- or herself.</p>
