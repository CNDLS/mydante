<h3>Dante  is for Everyone</h3> <blockquote> I have chosen the <em>Commedia</em> for this first talk because I am a man of letters and I believe that the apex  of literature, of all literature, is the <em>Commedia</em>.  This does not imply that I agree with its  theology, or with its mythology, which is a combination of Christian and pagan  myths.  What it means is that no book has  given me such intense aesthetic emotions.   And, I repeat, I am a hedonistic reader; I look for emotion in books.<br/> The <em>Commedia </em>is a book  that everyone ought to read.  Not to do  so is to deprive oneself of the greatest gift that literature can give us; it  is to submit to a strange asceticism. Why should we deny ourselves the joy of  reading the <em>Commedia</em>?  Besides, it  is not difficult to read.  What is  difficult is outside of the reading: the opinions, the discussions.  But the book itself is crystalline.  And there is the central character, Dante,  who is perhaps the most vivid character in literature, not to mention the other  characters.  	 (Jorge Luis Borges, <em>Poets Dante</em>, 130) 	</blockquote> <p>Art is for  everyone. Citizenship is for everyone. Religion (in a certain sense) is for  everyone. Love is for everyone. Life and Death are for everyone. Dante is for  everyone, for all of us today!</p> <p>Borges said that  no one should deprive oneself of the joy of reading the <em>Commedia</em>. But why? What is this joy that reading the poem  promises? There is reason to think that no one can say what the human  experience of joy means, that it is mysterious and therefore ineffable.  Dantes poem, all 14,233 lines of it, is itself a testimony to the impossibility of expressing it, and yet we have his word that it is a reality  and that he himself experienced it, or at least caught a glimpse of its  reality, an impossible reality, to which he believed with his whole person he  was called to witness and testify. Why would anyone undertake this journey of  our life, even if only poetically and in imagination, believing its  destination and his destiny to be mysteriously impossible, if not on the word of  a witness would one trusted beyond all reason? And even then, would that be motive enough, unless to it was added the impulse of a hunger and thirst so  profound that one knew with ones whole heart and mind that nothing in the  world could satisfy it, nothing possible could possibly be enough, so that it  must be a hunger and thirst for something impossible, something out of this  world. One cannot read the <em>Commedia</em> with being confronted with the question of joy, whether or not one believes in  it, lives in the hope of it, is journeying toward it ones whole life. If one does read the poem as it invites and demands to be read, then one takes up the  question, Who Am I? just as Dante the pilgrim and poet did, and becomes  responsible for and to that question for ones whole life, for the whole of  ones life, responsible for to the death which alone completes ones life and  makes it whole. The poem as a whole is a imaginative metaphor for the  relationship each person has to his or her own life and death as a whole, a  relationship which is lived as a loving, a passionate desire and an intimate  cherishing of the impossible experience of joy, joy give as a gift, the gift of  the other without whom one can be oneself, cannot say I. This is the faith and  hope of the poem, the faith and hope of a way of  living life and a journey to the joy of love,  a joy which cannot be grasped in any way, in word or act, but can only be given  as the gift of ones whole self, ones life and death. Perhaps we can say this  much: Dantes poem expresses the faith and hope that an impossible joy is for  everyone.</p> <p>But such words,  any words, <em>about</em> the poem, are  meaningless without the poem itself. <em>Inferno</em> 1 shows the reader what it means for a person to be lost in life, not simply to  have lost this or that, but to have lost oneself, to have lost ones way, the  true way, (<em>verace via)</em>, to find  that ones way of being true to oneself, the straight way (<em>via diritta</em>), has disappeared. The journey begins in the experience  of loss. <em>Inferno </em>1 reveals only two  things about the character whom the reader encounters:  that he is lost, and then he is found. First,  he finds himself lost, terrified to death (<em>Tante`  amar che poco piu e` morte).</em> Second, he has abandoned all hope of going on.  Attempting to climb the hill toward the light of the rising sun, he is routed  by leopard, lion, wolf and sent careening back to where, wonderful image, the  sun is speechless. (<em>là dove 'l sol tace</em>)  But as he touches bottom, at the bottom of the hill, poetry comes to his rescue,  or rather, not poetry but my teacher and my poet (<em>Tu se' lo mio maestro e 'l mio autore</em>).</p> <p>That is the  whole story, not just of <em>Inferno</em> 1,  but of the whole poem. Lost and found. Its that simple: Life, death, life  again  if you believe the story, the whole story, the whole poem. Life lost,  the old life, which ironically, he once called the "New Life" (Vita  Nuova).  Everything that he ever was:  poet, innovative and self-promoting; citizen, effective and ambitious;  believer, searching and restless; lover ardent an impressionable; all gone,  except the tenuous (<em>fioco</em>,) thread  that still connected him to poetry, long silent (<em>per lungo silenzio</em>), now embodied in Virgil, sent by God to guide  him to God's own city.  Virgil promises  to help him find again all of himself that is lost, poetry, citizenship, belief  -- all except love -- for that, Virgil tells him, a "soul more worthy than  I (<em>anima  	più di me degna</em>) shall  come to help him.</p> <p>We first meet  Dante lost -- stripped of his entire identity: his vocation and profession as  poet, now long silent; his citizenship now forfeited to exile; his religious  belief, shaken to the foundation, Job-like, and the ever more distant memory of  the love he had lost, clung to with a promise now long unkept. Clearly, the  Dante of Inferno one is Everyman: Art is for everyone; citizenship is for  everyone; religion (in a certain sense) is for everyone; love the hunger and  thirst of desire, the promise of life, for life, promise made, kept and broken  scratch that broke in and kept, love is for everyone. Everyone is lost.  Life is lost.   Everyone dies.  Life and Death are  for everyone.  Dante is for everyone.</p> <p><u>Art is for  Everyone</u></p> <p>Art, the work of  imagination and human hands, produces food and drink for the human spirit.  What bread and water are to the body, the  "works of imagination" (<em>poiesis)</em> are to the spirit.  <em>Poiesis</em>, the work of art, is the human vocation, the profession of  a commitment to "decorate" life, which is to say, make it decorous  (Latin, <em>decus</em> -- fitting or  appropriate for a divine purpose).  In  this sense, all art is decorative art.   Art is the vocation and profession of everyone to make the bodily world  decorous and fittingly appropriate to the dignity of a higher purpose.  The work of art is to feed the hungry, give  drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, reverence the dead... human  spirit.  Art transforms body into  spirit.  Through imagination, art makes  metaphor -- the figure of same and different, the figure of  transformation.  <em>Poiesis</em> is the work of conversion, the work of metaphoric  transformation, the turning of life into death, and through death, into life  again -- new life, life transformed.</p> <p>Art is always a  matter of human life and death.  It is  the consumption of the material, the bodily, the consumption of physical life  to be transformed in the work of art into spirit.  What digestion is to the body, the "work  of art" is to the spirit, the work of imaginative transformation of body  into spirit. Because <em>poiesis </em>is the  work of transformation, art as vocation and profession requires  conversion.  The poet must first undergo  what later she will do.  No one can be  committed to art without undergoing conversion, life lost and found again, new  and different. Following the model of Augustine in the <em>Confessions</em>, Dante the poet writes the story of the pilgrim as a journey of conversion.<br/> Read <a href='http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1995/heaney-lecture.html'>Seamus  Heaney's Nobel Prize lecture "Crediting Poetry</a> for a testimony to the  vocation and profession of a large as a process of personal conversion.  Heaney's testimony parallels remarkably  closely the experience and testimony of Dante the poet in the <em>Commedia.</em>  It is for this reason that Heaney says:</p> <blockquote>Only  the very stupid or the very deprived can any longer help knowing that the  documents of civilization have been written in blood and tears, blood and tears no less real for being very remote. And when this intellectual predisposition  coexists with the actualities of Ulster and Israel and Bosnia and Rwanda and a  host of other wounded spots on the face of the earth, the inclination is not  only not to credit human nature with much constructive potential but not to  credit anything too positive in the work of art. <br/> <br/> Which  is why for years I was bowed to the desk like some monk bowed over his  prie-dieu, some dutiful contemplative pivoting his understanding in an attempt  to bear his portion of the weight of the world, knowing himself incapable of  heroic virtue or redemptive effect, but constrained by his obedience to his  rule to repeat the effort and the posture. Blowing up sparks for a meagre heat,  forgetting faith, straining towards good works. Attending insufficiently to the  diamond absolutes, among which must be counted the sufficiency of that which is  absolutely imagined. Then finally and happily, and not in obedience to the  dolorous circumstances of my native place but in despite of them, I straightened up. I began a few years ago to try to make space in my reckoning  and imagining for the marvelous as well as for the murderous.</blockquote> <u>Citizenship is  for Everyone</u> <p>Like the Psalms  of Hebrew Scripture, the<em> Commedia</em> is  a song of exile: Dante's exile from Florence; the human exile from Eden, the  original home, enacted by Mother Eve and Father Adam in the name of every  one.  Exile is the loss of home.  It is the original punishment for the  original sin, the sin of betrayal.  Exile  is the most terrible form of punishment that can be imposed on a person, short  of a death penalty.  It is the closest  one can come to death without dying, for it is to be cut off from home, from  all that one loves. Dante work the entire <em>Commedia</em> while in exile, out of the experience of exile. Peculiar, how strangely at home  poetry is in exile.<br/> Exile turns poetry toward politics.  Exile enforces a justice which originates in the bonds of trust arising from a  covenant among persons.  Justice tries,  always imperfectly, to keep the faith of promises made and broken, in the hope  of renewed promises, in the hope of a new covenant to keep.  Politics, the art of citizenship invented by  the Greeks, codified by Rome, labors after the imperfect ideal of justice,  trying desperately and indignantly to keep faith with broken promises in the  hope of mercy, the hope for forgiveness given as a new covenant, a new,  different faith renewed in the face of betrayal.  Betrayal is the face of sin, "original  sin," as Christian theology calls it, the face of the original sinners  whom the pilgrim discovers in the lowest pit of Hell.</p> <p>No one reads the<em> Commedia </em>without being singed by the heat of Dante's indignant,  humiliated, desperate and almost despairing, pleading demand for justice.  In one sense, the poetic plea/demand for  justice in the<em> Commedia </em>is clearly  prophetic; it is Dantes jeremiad.But as plea\demand, the call for justice  is inescapably ambivalent, like all human experience in so far as it is marked  by what religion calls "sin," particularly original sin.  Whatever meaning is given to the theological metaphor of "sin," without which the <em>Commedia </em>would be incomprehensible, that meaning is fully as  mysterious as the impossible joy to which Dante's "gospel" bears  witness.  Reading the poem, one might  well begin to suspect that Dante's politics and his pleading demand for justice  which that politics expresses and articulates are decidedly idiosyncratic,  partisan, more motivated by the wounded drive for revenge than by sober respect  for justice.  Nor should this suspicion  be lightly dismissed. Real ambivalence has real consequences.  The ambivalence of politics, however, is not  limited to Dantes case alone. Every political demand and prophetic plea for  justice is inescapably marked by the mysterious ambivalence in which betrayal  and guilt are genuinely universal, original and enduring realities.  The pilgrim's terror before the gates of Hell  in <em>Inferno</em>,3 is triggered precisely by the shocking clarity of the  inscription they bear declaring this very truth: Betrayal is forever a real possibility, as real as the possibility of love, with which it originates  together.  Justice can look and feel as  much like Hell as it can Heaven.  The  pilgrim's progress through Hell and the other realms will not so much achieve  justice and finally resolve its ambiguity as it will convert every political  notion of justice and citizenship into an altogether transformed vision of what  it is to be at home in existence as a whole after having returned from exile.</p> <p>Discussion of the essential  ambivalence of politics, of citizenship as a basic human identity, and of the  imperfect ideal of justice is in no way abstract in relation to the poem.  It has its perfect embodiment in Virgil, the  guide, the helper, the pilgrim's "teacher and poet."  As poet, Virgil is the spirit and voice of  Aeneas's journey from fallen Troy to triumphant Rome, a journey which clearly  serves as the paradigm for Dante's own.   All of the many allegorical identities attributed to Virgil in the <em>Commedia</em>, including that of the voice of  "natural" reason and moral conscience, unenlightened and unrectified  by divine grace yet exemplary in its self actualization, have this final  significance: Virgil embodies Dante's ambivalent relationship to his cultural  paternity,., to his metaphoric "father," the complex legacy of  Greco-Roman "pagan humanism as he knew it. This legacy was, on the one  hand, the steady, reliable and effective guardian of his youthful, if not quite innocent, dreams, ambitions, and sense of self-worth and self-mastery, while  simultaneously being, on the other hand, fatefully flawed and limited in  fulfilling this role.  Right from the  beginning, Virgil tells the lost pilgrim that the voice of poetry and the  patrimony of the Greco-Roman philosophical ideal of citizenship as the  guarantor of justice will not be sufficient to his need.  Fathers always fail and must be  surpassed.  That is their destiny and  purpose.  They are sacrificial figures,  and in Dante's economy of homecoming and homemaking, sacrifice is  insufficiently credit-worthy to supply the present need.  Behind Virgil stand all human fathers, both  personal and cultural, deeply ambivalent and limited in their patriarchal  patrimony.</p> <p>But in particular,  two fathers of Western culture, two originators of Dantes patrimony, stand  behind Virgil: Socrates and Abraham.   Both are deeply loved, held in the strongest bonds of filial loyalty and  gratitude, yet both are recognized from the beginning to be only foster  fathers, beloved guardians and guides, but ultimately, only substitutes.  But substitutes for whom, for what?  For the missing, "original," divine  father?  That would be a natural, but  clumsy guess.  The reality must be more  mysterious than any simple polarity -- father/mother, human/divine, life/death  could intimate.  The question remains  here in suspense.</p> <p>More immediately to the purpose is  to clarify the relationship of Socrates and Abraham to Virgil.  The common thread of connection is the notion  of sacrifice and the cultural association of sacrifice with  "paternity" and therefore with the privilege of "originality,  and hence of divinity, at least in the sense of authoritative power.  Socrates and Abraham are linked in the  confluence of two patrimonial streams that merge in Virgil and represent two  distinctive styles of embodying and exemplifying the heroic ideal: the ideal of  overcoming death by means of honor earned through sacrifice.  Plato, in the Republic, particularly in the  so-called "Allegory of the Cave," triumphantly presents the image of  the "Philosopher-King," a thinly veiled repetition of the portrait of  Socrates presented in the courtroom drama of the Apology, as the mythic  inheritor of the Greek heroic tradition reaching back through Achilles and  Odysseus to Hercules, Theseus, and Jason.   Socrates, as Philosopher- King, enacts the tragic drama of heroic  self-sacrifice in the name of justice for the good of the community. Plato  teaches that inherent in the Greek notion of citizenship is the sure knowledge that the highest good of the individual cannot be achieved unless it is shared  equally by all, since it is necessarily the "common good," the good  which is the same for all.  By contrast,  Abraham, hero of faith rather than of justice, represents a different style of  sacrifice, but to the same effect. He becomes the father, not just of Isaac,  but of a great nation," by enacting the role of  "Patriarch-Priest," rather than Philosopher-King, by means of his  ready willingness to sacrifice his beloved son in order to remain faithful to  his covenant with the transcendent and mysterious Yahweh.</p> <p>Socrates as  stoic, self-sacrificing Philosopher-King and Abraham as Patriarch-Priest, ready  to sacrifice every human love stand behind Virgils role as the prophet of <em>pius Aeneas.</em> Aeneass style of heroism  is distinct evolutionary mutation of these two, and as such mediates their  passing over into Dante literary and political milieu. Aeneas is the divinely  fated pilgrim-refugee from fallen Troy who clears the way (<em>via diritta</em>) and plants the seed of the dream of empire, the Roman  empire that was the necessary earthly condition and type of the Kingdom of God  on earth, initiated by the sacrifice of Jesus, who also perfectly fulfills the  archetypal patterns of both willing self-sacrifice and sacrifice of the  beloved.  In Virgil, then, we have the  foster father, guardian and guide, who knows the way through everything that  must be experienced so as to be left behind and so surpassed, who watches over  the conversion of the exiled Dantes indignant and humiliated pleading demand  for justice achieved through sacrifice into the acceptance of a higher law of  forgiving love.  For the vision of the <em>Commedia</em>, sacrifice, of which Virgil is  the master poet, must remain forever only the substitute for the promise of joy  a promise which can only be made in the face of betrayal, a promise which  justice can neither make nor keep. Each reader journeys with the pilgrim  through every possible twist and turn in the necessary though impossible quest  for justice which must in the end be converted to the love that embodied itself  as forgiveness, received and given freely for everyone.</p> <p><u>Religion  is for Everyone</u></p> <p>If  there is anything that would appear clear and straightforward about the <em>Commedia</em>, it would have to be that it is  a religious poem, specifically a Christian poem.  Furthermore, however original and imaginative  his portrayal of the afterlife or highly personal, even idiosyncratic, his  appropriation of the Gospel message, to suggest that the author of the poem  presents himself through it as anyone other than a believer committed to all  the most central doctrines of Christianity, including a Trinitarian God,  creation, sin, Incarnation, Redemption, Resurrection and Final Judgment, and  all this understood in a way that is basically traditional and orthodox, would  be to make a mockery of the seamless testimony of every line of the text.</p> <p>Nevertheless,  the recognition that the narrative worldview of the poem is straightforwardly  Christian in no way forecloses the question of interpretation -- what does the  poem mean?  -- or the question of  reflection -- is it true, and if so, what significance does it hold for human  living?  Regardless whether a reader does  or does not identify herself personally with the Christian worldview and way of  life, or with any recognizable religion at all; regardless whether one is a  believer, an agnostic, an atheist or something else, in order to read the poem  with understanding, one must recognize that it inescapably confronts one with a  religious question for which one cannot evade taking responsibility.  The poem raises a question so radical, so  humanly universal and fundamental that it cannot be adequately comprehended by  any question of the existence or nonexistence of a God or gods, however it/they  might be named or conceived, let alone by any question of the truth and  goodness of the worldview and way of life sanctioned by the culture of any  particular religion.  As paradoxical as  it might appear at first, this question of religion before, or even without,  God and religious culture is not only a real one, it is in a certain important  sense the only question that takes the religious dimension of human existence  and identity fully seriously, because it plainly reveals that the fundamental religious question is not primarily about the divine, but about the human, or  more accurately about the possibility of   a human experience of a relationship between what we call the  "human" and the "divine." But the crucial concern of this  question is not with the "calling" or "naming," but with  the quality of the relationship that requires and allows this calling and  naming to occur, to take hold, to bond and bind, to hold true. It is ultimately  a question not so much of belief precisely, but of trust, personal trust.  It is an entirely personal question: Do you,  personally, trust "trusting?"   Is human personal existence trustworthy?</p> <p><em>For more on the  fundamental religious question, see the section on the four major themes.</em></p>
