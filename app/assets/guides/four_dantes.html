<p><strong>FOUR DANTES</strong><br />
 <br />
 And there is the central character, Dante, who is perhaps the most vivid character in literature
 <br />
 <em>Jorge Luis Borges, The Poets' Dante, p. 130</em> <br />
 <br />
 &nbsp;In Dante's poetry<em>, </em>the strands of Dante's identity interweave, separating and coming together in different ways. As we begin our journey nel mezzo, it is useful to try to unravel these strands and to see where in Dante's life and works they lead us.  Here, we consider the identities of Dante the Believer, Dante the Citizen, Dante the Lover, and Dante the Poet, but these are certainly not the only strands we might follow. As you read, notice what other Dantes you encounter and think about where those identities might lead you.<br />
 These aspects of Dante's identity interweave throughout the poem and through any interpretation of it: Dante the Poet who invites the reader to join him in the Commedia's journey of our life, along the way fundamentally transforming the Italian language; Dante the Believer, who, as the pilgrim in the journey, struggles with&nbsp; the fundamental questions of mystery, meaning, and freedom against the backdrop of medieval Christianity;&nbsp; Dante the Citizen, who is defined by his historical time and place until torn away from Florence in exile; Dante the Lover, who feels so intensely for Beatrice and yearns to inscribe those emotions in writing.&nbsp; Exploring the interplay of these four aspects of identity will deepen the reader's dialogue with Dante and further illuminate the questions of Who is Dante? and Who am I?<br />
 <br />
 Your reading of R.W.B Lewis' <em>Dante, </em>chapters I-V, will give you a brief overview of Dante's literary biography. The comments below are intended to help pull that information together into a preliminary composite image of this person whom you will come to know more personally as you read his work.<br />
 <br />
 <strong><br />
 Dante the Believer<br />
 </strong><br />
 [T]he Comedy throughout sustains the equilibrium we have been told to look for in a haiku by Basho. There is no rift, as in conventional allegory, between action and interpretation, physical and moral, low' and high.' All is of a piece. It is a mystic's view of the world, if you like. It is also a scientist's. James Merrill, The Poets' Dante, p. 235.<br />
 <br />
 Dante is firmly situated within his time and place, and must be understood as a religious Christian poet. The <em>Commedia </em>can be read as a confession of sorts, a testimony or even a Gospel. <br />
 We must be aware of Christianity's impact on Dante's worldview, but at the same time, we cannot let this restrict our understanding of the poem. Through the lens of Christianity  the particular Christianity of his time and place  Dante addresses questions which are universal.<br />
 <br />
 Regardless whether a reader does or does not identify herself personally with the Christian worldview and way of life, or with any recognizable religion at all; regardless whether one is a believer, an agnostic, an atheist or something else, in order to read the poem with understanding, one must recognize that it inescapably confronts one with a religious question for which one cannot evade taking responsibility.&nbsp; The poem raises a question so radical, so humanly universal and fundamental that it cannot be adequately comprehended by any question of the existence or nonexistence of a God or gods, however it/they might be named or conceived, let alone by any question of the truth and goodness of the worldview and way of life sanctioned by the culture of any particular religion.&nbsp; <br />
 <br />
 As paradoxical as it might appear at first, this question of religion before, or even without, God and religious culture is not only a real one, it is in a certain important sense the only question that takes the religious dimension of human existence and identity fully seriously, because it plainly reveals that the fundamental religious question is not primarily about the divine, but about the human, or more accurately about the possibility of&nbsp; a human experience of a relationship between what we call the &quot;human&quot; and the &quot;divine.&quot; But the crucial concern of this question is not with the &quot;calling&quot; or &quot;naming,&quot; but with the quality of the relationship that requires and allows this calling and naming to occur, to take hold, to bond and bind, to hold true. It is ultimately a question not so much of belief precisely, but of trust, personal trust.&nbsp; It is an entirely personal question: Do you, personally, trust &quot;trusting?&quot;&nbsp; Is human personal existence trustworthy? <br />

<p><strong>Dante the Citizen </strong></p>
<p>What I first loved in the Commedia was the local intensity, the vehemence and fondness attaching to individual shades, the way personalities and values were emotionally soldered together, the strong strain of what has been called personal realism in the celebration of bonds of friendship and bonds of enmity. The way in which Dante could place himself in an historical world yet submit that world to scrutiny from a perspective beyond history, the way he could accommodate the political and the transcendent, this too encouraged my attempt at a sequence of poems which would explore the typical strains which the consciousness labours under in this country.&nbsp; The main tension is between two often contradictory commands: to be faithful to the collective history experience and to be true to the recognitions of the emerging self. <br />
 <em> Seamus Heaney, The Poets' Dante, p. 256.</em><br />
 <br />
 Politics played a crucial role in Dante's life, in part by virtue of the time and place in which he lived. The complex relationship between the Guelf and Ghibelline factions, almost incomprehensible today, permeated Florentine life.&nbsp; Dante acted in a number of different political roles, bureaucratic and diplomatic, until he was ultimately exiled from Florence.&nbsp; It is impossible to separate Dante's life story from the political context which surrounds it, as the political events affected him on every level from the professional to the deeply personal. Written outside of Florence, yet so intimately connected to that city's history, politics, and people, the <em>Commedia </em>is in many ways Dante's song of exile. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 <strong>Chronology:</strong><br />
 <strong>1267</strong>  By this time the Guelfs have expelled the Ghibellines from Florence.<br />
 <strong>1282</strong>  Guelf Popolo returns to power.<br />
 <strong>1289</strong>  Dante is present at, and probably participates in, the battle of Campaldino,<br />
 in which the exiled Ghibellines, attempting to re-enter Florence, were defeated by the Guelfs. Dante recalls this battle in Purgatorio.<br />
 <strong>1294</strong>  Dante meets Charles Martel, king of Hungary and heir to the kingdom of Naples and the <br />
 country of Provence. Dante recounts this meeting in Paradiso VII.<br />
 <strong>1295</strong>  Dante becomes a member of the Arte dei Medici e Speziali (the guild of physicians and <br />
 apothecaries), which qualifies him to participate in Florentine politics.<br />
 He serves as a representative (in the Trentasei del Capitano) and council member (of the Council of One Hundred). <br />
 <strong>1300</strong>  Dante serves as one of seven priors of the city of Florence. <br />
 Feuding between two factions, the so-called White Guelfs and Black Guelfs, escalates, and the leaders of each faction are banished, including Dante's friend Guido Cavalcanti, who dies while in exile.<br />
 <strong>1301</strong>  Dante is sent by the White Guelfs as an ambassador to Pope Boniface VII, but the Pope <br />
 has already sent Charles of Valois to Florence to settle the dispute between the Whites and Blacks. While Dante is away, the Blacks gain control of the city, and the Whites, including Dante, are banished from Florence.<br />
 <strong>1302</strong>  Dante is exiled from Florence for two years, a sentence which is subsequently increased <br />
 to banishment for life.<br />
 <strong>1304</strong>  The exiled White Guelfs plot an attack on Florence, which fails. Dante cuts ties with the <br />
 group. <br />
 <strong>1315</strong>  Florence offers to repeal Dante's exile, in exchange for admission of guilt and partial <br />
 payment of fines, but he rejects this offer.<br />
 <strong>1318-1321</strong>  Dante lives in Ravenna as a guest of Guido Novello da Polenta.<br />
 <strong>1321</strong>  Dante is sent as an ambassador to Venice by Guido Novello da Polenta, and becomes ill <br />
 upon his return to Ravenna. He dies on the 13th or 14th of September.<br />
 <br />
 <strong><br />
 Dante the Lover</strong></p>
<p>[T]he great poet should not only perceive and distinguish more clearly than other men, the colors or sounds within the range of ordinary vision or hearing; he should perceive vibrations beyond the range of ordinary men, and be able to make men hear more at each end than they could ever see without his help
. The Divine Comedy expresses everything in the way of emotion, between depravity's despair and the beatific vision, that man is capable of experiencing.&nbsp; It is therefore a constant reminder to the poet, of the obligation to explore, to find words for the inarticulate, to capture those feelings which people can hardly even feel, because they have no words for them; and at the same time, a reminder that the explorer beyond the frontiers of ordinary consciousness will only be able to return and report to his fellow citizens, if he has all the time a firm grasp upon the realities with which they are already acquainted. <br />
 <em>T.S. Eliot, The Poets' Dante, p. 38</em><br />
 <br />
 Dante's <em>Commedia </em>is his fulfillment of his promise to write what [had] never been written in rhyme of any woman  that is, to write an entirely new kind of love poem (Vita nuova, XLII). As we will see, the poem proves to be revolutionary in a number of ways, not the least of which is its transformation of the conception of the self and the other. It is important to understand the courtly love tradition which surrounded Dante's work  for more on this, see [link to document on courtly love in the Biblioteca]. As you read, consider how Dante follows and departs from this tradition.<br />
 At another level, however, the poem is simply a love poem. <br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 <strong>Chronology:</strong><br />
 <strong>1274</strong>  Dante first meets and falls in love with Beatrice, according to the Vita Nuova.<br />
 <strong>1284-1290&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;-- Dante writes the poetry of the Vita Nuova.<br />
 <strong>1287</strong>  Beatrice marries Simone de' Bardi. <br />
 <strong>1290</strong>  Beatrice dies (June 8).<br />
</p>
<p><strong><br />
Dante the Poet</strong></p>
<p>The whole study and practice of Dante seems to me to teach that the poet should be the servant of his language, rather than the master of it
.Dante seems to me to have a place in Italian literature which, in this respect, only Shakespeare has in ours; that is, they give body to the soul of the language, conforming themselves, the one more and the other less consciously, to what they divined to be its possibilities
To pass on to posterity one's own language, more highly developed, more refined, and more precise than it was before one wrote it, that is the highest possible achievement of the poet as poet. <em>T.S. Eliot, The Poets' Dante, p. 38</em><br />
 <br />
 <strong>Chronology:<br />
  1284-1290</strong>  Dante writes the poetry of the Vita Nuova.<br />
 <strong>1293-94</strong>  Dante writes the prose sections of the Vita Nuova.<br />
 <strong>1294</strong>  Dante's Vita Nuova is published. <br />
 <strong>1300</strong>  Year in which the fictional journey of the Divina Commedia takes place (at Eastertime).<br />
 Between <strong>1304</strong> and <strong>1307</strong>, Dante writes the unfinished works De vulgari eloquentia and Convivio. <br />
 <strong>1308</strong>  By this time, Dante has begun work on the Divina Commedia..<br />
 <strong>1314</strong>  Inferno is published. During this time, Dante works on Paradiso and Paradiso, and writes the Questio de acque et terra. <br />
 <br />
 Dante wrote the Commedia as an invitation to undertake a journey of self-discovery, an invitation which was clearly and emphatically extended to all.&nbsp; When it first appeared, Dante's writing was revolutionary in its use of a new language and style. The new language was the local dialect of Dante's city and region that would eventually, largely because of his poem, become Italian. He wrote in the vernacular, vulgar tongue rather than in Latin because he wanted the widest possible audience, not just the lettered elite. And he wanted that widest possible audience not just because he was personally ambitious, though he certainly was that, but because the poem would be for everyone. It would tell, as he says in its very first line, of the journey of our life. <br />
 <br />
 Dante's new writing style separates the so-called ancient and medieval worlds from the so-called modern world. The cutting edge of that new style is its sharp emphasis on the experience of the singular human person rather than on the authority of community, tradition, church or state. Some saw this emphatic shift as a Renaissance of classical humanism; others as a Reformation of Christianity. Later, it was viewed as a new age of Enlightenment and a Romantic adventure. Still, however many the branches, its roots were in the time and place of Dante; its soil was the heritage he received and passed on, transformed forever. <br />
