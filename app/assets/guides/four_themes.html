<p><strong>FOUR  THEMES</strong><br />
 <strong>1. &nbsp;Mystery and  Meaning</strong><br />
 <br />Mystery names the fundamental experience of all human life  in its essential structure of tension between opposite but interrelated  possibilities: the experience of a power larger than the human which resists  and limits human understanding and initiative in the world, the experience of  finitude, epitomized by death; and the corollary experience of a power which  both invites and capacitates a limited but effective transcendence of the  boundaries of human existence and the possibilities of becoming at home in the  world despite its unremitting enclosure by mystery. Mystery is not a trackless  void but a field of force, like gravity, in which a set of navigational  coordinates has already become embedded: not north, south, east and west, but  presence, absence, same and different. <br />
 <br />The confrontation  with mystery turns out to be a revelation of the divine. Here, however,  divine does not mean god(s); gods have names. The power of mystery, which  is divine and which precedes every name of god, has this quality: it not only  silences us, but also demands a response. Because it is all around us,  encircling every question of origin and destiny, our relationship to mystery is  necessary, and we experience this necessity as our fate. Thus it provokes the  radical crisis of human existence: not what to say, but is there any point to  saying anything at all, because mystery defeats the point of language. It  overflows and swamps the reach of words for meaning. Like a swimmer in danger  of drowning, the question sooner or later becomes is there any point to  further struggle? Must I not let go and go under?<br />
 <br />
 <em>The Fundamental Religious Question</em><u> </u><br />
 Noticing  that this question is entirely paradoxical, completely impossible to answer,  because it is not only conceptually, but also existentially self-referential is  like hearing the click just before realizing that a trap door has sprung open  beneath one's feet, and one is falling, a sinking feeling of not knowing when,  how, if one's absolute subjection to the law of gravity will end.  To be human is to be conscious of being in  &quot;free-fall;&quot; it is to find oneself lost, without reference,  orientation, or motive force. It is precisely at this instant that the  fundamental religious question precipitates. Life itself asks of every life and  requires all to respond:  This instant of  finding oneself lost, in free fall, does it mean something, anything, or is it  purely, utterly absurd? Meaning or absurdity: to live is to live as if one or  other descriptor held true of the human situation as a whole for all. If one  lives, consciously or unconsciously (it really does not matter) as if this lost  situation were meaningful, part a whole larger than itself, then one has taken that experience of free fall and converted it into what Kierkegaard famously  dubbed the leap of faith. One has decided to have faith, to entrust the  whole of ones existence and identity to the blind adventure of meaning, to  live ones life as a pilgrim search for the meaning of the whole, unknown but  now grasped and comprehended in the instantaneous decision of faith.  Religion is for all a matter of this experience of faith arising out the  question of meaning or absurdity, and of the hope and love that necessarily must sustain and complete it, while God names, for some, its mysterious  Other.<br />
 This  is the situation in which the pilgrim finds himself in the opening lines of <em>Inferno</em>, 1.  The Dark Wood, without a straight, true path,  because in this situation, those words must remain meaningless until the prior  question of meaning itself has been decided. The pilgrims initial situation,  lost and wandering aimlessly in the Dark Wood of sin, is not unique to him: he  is a type of Everyman, representative of human existence in general, hemmed  in by finitude and in flight from the need to recognize and acknowledge his  authentic condition. This condition can be understood as a confrontation with  mystery, but this confrontation is not an isolated episode, a single event; it  is, rather, both radical and critical. Radical in the sense that it is at the  root of all the more specific circumstances and events of life; critical in the  sense that it provokes a crisis situation in which judgment and decision are  demanded as necessary and inevitable. </p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Language &amp;  Metaphor</strong><br />
 The experience of the power of mystery is originally and necessarily commingled  with the experience of language. The experience of mystery occurs as silence;  silence marks the boundary between mystery and language. Apart from language,  nothing meaningful exists. There is only silence, the amniotic region of the  womb. It is a region alive with the vibrations of life not yet born into the  world. There are not yet words. The experience of silence is not merely the  absence of words and communication, but of a power which simultaneously demands  and yet refuses to give itself to words. Silence invites, perhaps even needs  words and meaning. This power to promise the transformation of silence into  language is mystery. Mystery is the silent promise of the Word. <br />
 <br />
 Mystery literally strikes us dumb;  bereaving us of speech; to confront mystery is to suffer the primal finitude of  the human condition, knowing that we do not know. The confrontation with  mystery forces us to recognize that the most glorious and effective power we  possess, the language of reason, must in the end fail us. We are, and will forever remain, unable to imagine or deliberately participate in the whole  story. We are in the dark, wandering and off-track because every trace of  the via diritta, the straight talk about where we are coming from and where we  are going, has vanished into thin air.<br />
 <br />
 Language creates new patterns of  relationship; meaning is nothing other than the new patterns of human engagement  with the world that emerge as possibilities for the first time in  language.&nbsp; Meaning is more than just naming; words have meaning not just  as labels for objects or activities, but by entering into a functionally  different kind of participating in and sharing of animal life. Meaning arises  out of the power and efficacy of language to create a world by transforming all  non-verbal interactions into a new dimension of shared possibility and  significance. If we take this new dimension of possibility and significance as  what makes us specifically and primarily human, then it becomes clear why we  must say that human beings and the world exist together in the medium of  language and only in language. Metaphor names the power of language to create  the world of human existence, the power which the Book of Genesis identifies  with the original divine self revelation and of which much latter the Gospel of  John identifies as the Word. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was  with God and was God. Through it all things were made
.<br />
 The pilgrims way is the way of  metaphor, and all meaning must be sought in the dynamic tension of opposites  that is its way of journeying: yes and no, life and death, light and dark,  masculine and feminine, divine and human. It is by journeying along this way of  metaphor, guided first by his master in poetry, Virgil, and then by his  mistress in love, Beatrice, that Dante reaches his destination and identity as  the poet of Loves way.<br />
 <br />
 Once the confrontation with mystery  has had its way with human existence, it is forever marked by the judgment that  is demanded of it. If it takes the way of negation and absurdity, then there  are no further questions to be asked; nothing meaningful to be said. Dante  judges this to be the condition of the damned, those who have lost the good of intellect. If it takes the way of faith, the search for meaning and  affirmation, the question not only remains but becomes the very ground upon  which it walks, for the original possibility of the other is now written in  its very identity as its deepest need. Thus it must forever walk the way of  metaphor, the way of both/and, same and different, known and unknown, which is  inscribed on its mind and heart and lips as the mark of its judgment. </p>
 <p><strong>3.  &nbsp;Identity</strong><br />
	  Lost in the dark wood, Dante embodies and  enacts the question of human identity: who am I? This question is no  abstraction; provoked by his confrontation with the divine power of mystery, it  is the reality of his situation, demanding a response in a decision about which  way he will go. The way he chooses will be his way of hoping, and through his  choosing he entrusts himself to it. His destiny and identity rest suspended in  the way to which he entrusts himself. This relationship of hope suspended in  trust works itself out in the dynamics of the first canto as a conversion  from one choice regarding a way of going on to another, totally different way.  Conversion means literally, in its English (and Italian) derivation from  Latin, a turning around, a changing of ones orientation and direction. But  in Dantes situation, his conversion is also directly related to the Greek etymology of the word metanoia, which corresponds in the Christian Scriptures  to the Latin conversio. Metanoia means a changed mind. Dante, inspired at  first by the hope of reaching the top of the hill, chooses to attempt the  ascent on his own, but is prevented from going that way by the three  allegorical beasts whom he encounters. It is in this moment of near despair  that help appears in the figure of Virgil, who informs him that he must change  his mind and convert to a new way of going on. This new way is determined not  simply a new direction or even a new destination, but by a new relationship to  his situation which involves entrusting his destiny no longer to himself, but  to another.<br />
	 <br />
	 Every great cultural  tradition has stored up riches of wisdom regarding the question who am I?  Eastern thought, Socratic philosophy, the Judeo-Christian-Islamic religious tradition and modern depth-psychology all radiate outward along their own  distinctive paths from this radical and critical question of human existence  which crystallizes at the center of the field of force engendered by the human  encounter with mystery. This center, or more accurately, centering question,  of identity, which in the West is traditionally called the soul, appears in the  thought of Carl Jung in terms of the distinction between the limited self of  individual ego-consciousness and the true Self, whose boundaries extend more  broadly and deeply than rationality and autonomy can describe. <br />
	 <br />
	Resonating with,  drawing on or anticipating all these traditions and others as well, Dantes  journey traces out a way of self-knowledge and identity which is, nonetheless, distinctive to the pilgrim-poet of the Commedia alone. Firmly rooted in the  soil of Christian imagination, Dantes understanding of human identity is  personal, incarnational, and trinitarian. A fuller sense of what is meant by  each of these terms must await development through the metaphors of the poem  itself, but by way of anticipation we can say that persons, whether human or  divine, as centers of freedom, in embodied, historical relation to other  persons, are the full and final expression of whatever meaning and truth can be  looked for in reality. Here, this view of Dantes regarding human identity,  rooted in the Christian imagination but distinctively his own, will be referred  to as relationalism, in itself an abstract enough term, to be sure; the  reader is asked not to forget, however, that it originates here in the context  of a reflection on the question who am I? as a universal and fundamental  human concern and that it opens up for Dante the path of a&nbsp; journey which  leads through the drama of freedom to the fulfillment of all desire in  mutuality of Love.</p>
	<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom &amp; Responsibility</strong><br />
	 We who lived in  concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting  others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number,  but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one  thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose ones own way....Dostoevsky  said once, there is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my  sufferings.&nbsp; These words frequently came to my mind after I became  acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering and  death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost. It  can be said that they were worthy of their sufferings; the way they bore their  suffering was a genuine inner achievement. It is this spiritual freedom - which  cannot be taken away - that makes life meaningful and purposeful. (Viktor  Frankl, Mans Search for Meaning, pp.86-87) <br />
	</p>
	<p>We have said that Dantes journey leads along the way of  metaphor and of the question of human identity. Now it becomes clear that this  same way leads us into the question of freedom: What am I capable of and  responsible for?  Clearly, this question  is directly linked to that of identity. Freedom determines who I am; it is  nothing other than the capacity to have an identity which is genuinely ones  own. This is the freedom which Frankl identifies as fundamental and  inalienable, the freedom to choose ones own way. Furthermore, it is clear at  once that freedom is mysterious and always more of the character of a question  than an answer. Jean-Paul Sartre sees to the heart of the matter in terms  strikingly reminiscent of Dantes vision when he says both that we are  condemned to be free, and that hell is other people.&nbsp; Human  freedom is always responsive to the power of divine mystery which has always  already seized the initiative in confronting it. Hence human freedom has its  identity in its ability to respond to this initiative, and this relationship of  responsibility opens up the possibilities of meaning and purpose in existence,  as well as the possibility of meaninglessness and alienation, as Sartre makes  clear. </p>
	<p>Put in this way, the form of the  question suggests a dual polarity in the dynamics of freedom: freedom for and  freedom from. This duality comes into focus, and with it the metaphoric  significance of Dantes heaven and hell, if we specify the question as: What  more might there be to freedom than liberty of choice? Because it is largely  external and circumstantial, liberty is primarily negative in character; it  focuses on options, cause and effect. Freedom in the fuller sense, however, is  focused more on relational identity and meaning. This becomes apparent in the  sort of situation Frankl describes, where virtually all liberty of choice has  been stripped away yet the drama of choice is heightened&nbsp; or deepened to  the level that is most proper to finite human existence as a whole: the level  of suffering. It is at that same level, the level of passion, that love and  hatred arise as possibilities: the choice we make about how we will go on in  relation to what is not ours to choose, the freedom of the other, shapes our  identity more profoundly than which options we exercise in life or even our  conscious reasons for doing so.<br />
	 </p>
	<p>Dorothy Sayers  has referred to the Commedia as the drama of the souls choice. This  characterization is uniquely appropriate because there is only one source of  history and the events which are the stuff of drama, and that is freedom.  Dantes journey is dramatic because it is colored throughout by the finality of  freedom. The souls choice is final not simply in the serial sense of being  irrevisable, but of being absolute with regard to its meaning: the freedom of  finite human existence becomes responsible for an identity which determines, in  significant part, the identity of every other freedom that exists, including  the divine. </p>
