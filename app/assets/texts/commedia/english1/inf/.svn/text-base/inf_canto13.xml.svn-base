		<l>Nessus had not yet reached the other bank</l>
		<l>when we began to make our way across</l>
		<l>a wood on which no path had left its mark</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No green leaves in that forest, only black;</l>
		<l>no branches straight and smooth, but knotted, gnarled;</l>
		<l>no fruits were there, but briers bearing poison</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even those savage beasts that roam between</l>
		<l>Cecina and Corneto, beasts that hate</l>
		<l>tilled lands, do not have holts so harsh and dense</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This is the nesting place of the foul Harpies,</l>
		<l>who chased the Trojans from the Strophades</l>
		<l>with sad foretelling of their future trials</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Their wings are wide, their necks and faces human;</l>
		<l>their feet are taloned, their great bellies feathered</l>
		<l>they utter their laments on the strange trees</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And my kind master then instructed me:</l>
		<l>&quot;Before you enter farther know that now</l>
		<l>you are within the second ring and shall</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>be here until you reach the horrid sand;</l>
		<l>therefore look carefully; you&apos;ll see such things</l>
		<l>as would deprive my speech of all belief&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>From every side I heard the sound of cries,</l>
		<l>but I could not see any source for them,</l>
		<l>so that, in my bewilderment, I stopped</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I think that he was thinking that I thought</l>
		<l>so many voices moaned among those trunks</l>
		<l>from people who had been concealed from us</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Therefore my master said: &quot;If you would tear</l>
		<l>a little twig from any of these plants,</l>
		<l>the thoughts you have will also be cut off&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I stretched out my hand a little way</l>
		<l>and from a great thornbush snapped off a branch,</l>
		<l>at which its trunk cried out: &quot;Why do you tear me?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then, when it had grown more dark with blood,</l>
		<l>it asked again: &quot;Why do you break me off?</l>
		<l>Are you without all sentiment of pity?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We once were men and now are arid stumps:</l>
		<l>your hand might well have shown us greater mercy</l>
		<l>had we been nothing more than souls of serpents&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As from a sapling log that catches fire</l>
		<l>along one of its ends, while at the other</l>
		<l>it drips and hisses with escaping vapor,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so from that broken stump issued together</l>
		<l>both words and blood; at which I let the branch</l>
		<l>fall, and I stood like one who is afraid</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My sage said: &quot;Wounded soul, if, earlier,</l>
		<l>he had been able to believe what he</l>
		<l>had only glimpsed within my poetry,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>then he would not have set his hand against you;</l>
		<l>but its incredibility made me</l>
		<l>urge him to do a deed that grieves me deeply</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But tell him who you were, so that he may,</l>
		<l>to make amends, refresh your fame within</l>
		<l>the world above, where he can still return&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>To which the trunk: &quot;Your sweet speech draws me so</l>
		<l>that I cannot be still; and may it not</l>
		<l>oppress you, if I linger now in talk</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I am the one who guarded both the keys</l>
		<l>of Frederick&apos;s heart and turned them, locking and</l>
		<l>unlocking them with such dexterity</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that none but I could share his confidence;</l>
		<l>and I was faithful to my splendid office,</l>
		<l>so faithful that I lost both sleep and strength</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The whore who never turned her harlot&apos;s eyes</l>
		<l>away from Caesar&apos;s dwelling, she who is</l>
		<l>the death of all and vice of every court,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>inflamed the minds of everyone against me;</l>
		<l>and those inflamed, then so inflamed Augustus</l>
		<l>that my delighted honors turned to sadness</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My mind, because of its disdainful temper,</l>
		<l>believing it could flee disdain through death,</l>
		<l>made me unjust against my own just self</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I swear to you by the peculiar roots</l>
		<l>of this thornbush, I never broke my faith</l>
		<l>with him who was so worthy-with my lord</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If one of you returns into the world,</l>
		<l>then let him help my memory, which still</l>
		<l>lies prone beneath the battering of envy&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The poet waited briefly, then he said</l>
		<l>to me: &quot;Since he is silent, do not lose</l>
		<l>this chance, but speak and ask what you would know</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I: &quot;Do you continue; ask of him</l>
		<l>whatever you believe I should request;</l>
		<l>I cannot, so much pity takes my heart&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then he began again: &quot;Imprisoned spirit,</l>
		<l>so may this man do freely what you ask,</l>
		<l>may it please you to tell us something more</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of how the soul is bound into these knots;</l>
		<l>and tell us, if you can, if any one</l>
		<l>can ever find his freedom from these limbs&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this the trunk breathed violently, then</l>
		<l>that wind became this voice: &quot;You shall be answered</l>
		<l>promptly When the savage spirit quits</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the body from which it has torn itself,</l>
		<l>then Minos sends it to the seventh maw</l>
		<l>It falls into the wood, and there&apos;s no place</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to which it is allotted, but wherever</l>
		<l>fortune has flung that soul, that is the space</l>
		<l>where, even as a grain of spelt, it sprouts</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It rises as a sapling, a wild plant;</l>
		<l>and then the Harpies, feeding on its leaves,</l>
		<l>cause pain and for that pain provide a vent</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Like other souls, we shall seek out the flesh</l>
		<l>that we have left, but none of us shall wear it;</l>
		<l>it is not right for any man to have</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>what he himself has cast aside We&apos;ll drag</l>
		<l>our bodies here; they&apos;ll hang in this sad wood,</l>
		<l>each on the stump of its vindictive shade&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And we were still intent upon the trunk-</l>
		<l>believing it had wanted to say more-</l>
		<l>when we were overtaken by a roar,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>just as the hunter is aware of chase</l>
		<l>and boar as they draw near his post-he hears</l>
		<l>the beasts and then the branches as they crack</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And there upon the left were two who, scratched</l>
		<l>and naked, fled so violently that</l>
		<l>they tore away each forest bough they passed</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The one in front: &quot;Now come, death, quickly come!&quot;</l>
		<l>The other shade, who thought himself too slow,</l>
		<l>was shouting after him: &quot;Lano, your legs</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>were not so nimble at the jousts of Toppo!&quot;</l>
		<l>And then, perhaps because he&apos;d lost his breath,</l>
		<l>he fell into one tangle with a bush</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Behind these two, black bitches filled the wood,</l>
		<l>and they were just as eager and as swift</l>
		<l>as greyhounds that have been let off their leash</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>They set their teeth in him where he had crouched;</l>
		<l>and, piece by piece, those dogs dismembered him</l>
		<l>and carried off his miserable limbs</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then he who was my escort took my hand;</l>
		<l>he led me to the lacerated thorn</l>
		<l>that wept in vain where it was bleeding, broken</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O Jacopo,&quot; it said, &quot;da Santo Andrea,</l>
		<l>what have you gained by using me as screen?</l>
		<l>Am I to blame for your indecent life?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When my good master stood beside that bush,</l>
		<l>he said: &quot;Who were you, who through many wounds</l>
		<l>must breathe with blood your melancholy words?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to us: &quot;O spirits who have come</l>
		<l>to witness the outrageous laceration</l>
		<l>that leaves so many of my branches torn,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>collect them at the foot of this sad thorn</l>
		<l>My home was in the city whose first patron</l>
		<l>gave way to John the Baptist; for this reason,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he&apos;ll always use his art to make it sorrow;</l>
		<l>and if-along the crossing of the Arno-</l>
		<l>some effigy of Mars had not remained,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>those citizens who afterward rebuilt</l>
		<l>their city on the ashes that Attila</l>
		<l>had left to them, would have travailed in vain</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I made-of my own house-my gallows place&quot;</l>
	</p>
