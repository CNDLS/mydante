	<p>
		<l>Now one of the hard borders bears us forward;</l>
		<l>the river mist forms shadows overhead</l>
		<l>and shields the shores and water from the fire.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as between Wissant and Bruges, the Flemings,</l>
		<l>in terror of the tide that floods toward them,</l>
		<l>have built a wall of dykes to daunt the sea;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and as the Paduans, along the Brenta,</l>
		<l>build bulwarks to defend their towns and castles</l>
		<l>before the dog days fall on Carentana;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>just so were these embankments, even though</l>
		<l>they were not built so high and not so broad,</l>
		<l>whoever was the artisan who made them.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>By now we were so distant from the wood</l>
		<l>that I should not have made out where it was-</l>
		<l>not even if I&apos;d turned around to look-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when we came on a company of spirits</l>
		<l>who made their way along the bank; and each</l>
		<l>stared steadily at us, as in the dusk,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>beneath the new moon, men look at each other.</l>
		<l>They knit their brows and squinted at us-just</l>
		<l>as an old tailor at his needle&apos;s eye.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And when that family looked harder, I</l>
		<l>was recognized by one, who took me by</l>
		<l>the hem and cried out: &quot;This is marvelous!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That spirit having stretched his arm toward me,</l>
		<l>I fixed my eyes upon his baked, brown features,</l>
		<l>so that the scorching of his face could not</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>prevent my mind from recognizing him;</l>
		<l>and lowering my face to meet his face,</l>
		<l>I answered him: &quot;Are you here, Ser Brunetto?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he: &quot;My son, do not mind if Brunetto</l>
		<l>Latino lingers for a while with you</l>
		<l>and lets the file he&apos;s with pass on ahead.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I said: &quot;With all my strength I pray you, stay;</l>
		<l>and if you&apos;d have me rest awhile with you,</l>
		<l>I shall, if that please him with whom I go.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O son,&quot; he said, &quot;whoever of this flock</l>
		<l>stops but a moment, stays a hundred years</l>
		<l>and cannot shield himself when fire strikes.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Therefore move on; below-but close-I&apos;ll follow;</l>
		<l>and then I shall rejoin my company,</l>
		<l>who go lamenting their eternal sorrows.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I did not dare to leave my path for his</l>
		<l>own level; but I walked with head bent low</l>
		<l>as does a man who goes in reverence.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he began: &quot;What destiny or chance</l>
		<l>has led you here below before your last</l>
		<l>day came, and who is he who shows the way?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;There, in the sunlit life above,&quot; I answered,</l>
		<l>&quot;before my years were full, I went astray</l>
		<l>within a valley. Only yesterday</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>at dawn I turned my back upon it-but</l>
		<l>when I was newly lost, he here appeared,</l>
		<l>to guide me home again along this path.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;If you pursue your star,</l>
		<l>you cannot fail to reach a splendid harbor,</l>
		<l>if in fair life, I judged you properly;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and if I had not died too soon for this,</l>
		<l>on seeing Heaven was so kind to you,</l>
		<l>I should have helped sustain you in your work.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But that malicious, that ungrateful people</l>
		<l>come down, in ancient times, from Fiesole-</l>
		<l>still keeping something of the rock and mountain-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for your good deeds, will be your enemy:</l>
		<l>and there is cause-among the sour sorbs,</l>
		<l>the sweet fig is not meant to bear its fruit.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The world has long since called them blind, a people</l>
		<l>presumptuous, avaricious, envious;</l>
		<l>be sure to cleanse yourself of their foul ways.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Your fortune holds in store such honor for you,</l>
		<l>one party and the other will be hungry</l>
		<l>for you-but keep the grass far from the goat.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For let the beasts of Fiesole find forage</l>
		<l>among themselves, and leave the plant alone-</l>
		<l>if still, among their dung, it rises up-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>in which there lives again the sacred seed</l>
		<l>of those few Romans who remained in Florence</l>
		<l>when such a nest of wickedness was built.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;If my desire were answered totally,&quot;</l>
		<l>I said to Ser Brunetto, &quot;you&apos;d still be</l>
		<l>among, not banished from, humanity.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Within my memory is fixed-and now</l>
		<l>moves me-your dear, your kind paternal image</l>
		<l>when, in the world above, from time to time</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>you taught me how man makes himself eternal;</l>
		<l>and while I live, my gratitude for that</l>
		<l>must always be apparent in my words.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>What you have told me of my course, I write;</l>
		<l>I keep it with another text, for comment</l>
		<l>by one who&apos;ll understand, if I may reach her.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>One thing alone I&apos;d have you plainly see:</l>
		<l>so long as I am not rebuked by conscience,</l>
		<l>I stand prepared for Fortune, come what may.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My ears find no new pledge in that prediction;</l>
		<l>therefore, let Fortune turn her wheel as she</l>
		<l>may please, and let the peasant turn his mattock.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this, my master turned his head around</l>
		<l>and toward the right, and looked at me and said:</l>
		<l>&quot;He who takes note of this has listened well.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But nonetheless, my talk with Ser Brunetto</l>
		<l>continues, and I ask of him who are</l>
		<l>his comrades of repute and excellence.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;To know of some is good;</l>
		<l>but for the rest, silence is to be praised;</l>
		<l>the time we have is short for so much talk.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>In brief, know that my company has clerics</l>
		<l>and men of letters and of fame-and all</l>
		<l>were stained by one same sin upon the earth.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That sorry crowd holds Priscian and Francesco</l>
		<l>d&apos;Accorso; and among them you can see,</l>
		<l>if you have any longing for such scurf,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the one the Servant of His Servants sent</l>
		<l>from the Arno to the Bacchiglione&apos;s banks,</l>
		<l>and there he left his tendons strained by sin.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I would say more; but both my walk and words</l>
		<l>must not be longer, for-beyond-I see</l>
		<l>new smoke emerging from the sandy bed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now people come with whom I must not be.</l>
		<l>Let my Tesoro, in which I still live,</l>
		<l>be precious to you; and I ask no more.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then he turned and seemed like one of those</l>
		<l>who race across the fields to win the green</l>
		<l>cloth at Verona; of those runners, he</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>appeared to be the winner, not the loser.</l>
