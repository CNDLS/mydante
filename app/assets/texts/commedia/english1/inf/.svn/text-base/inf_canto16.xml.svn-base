		<l>No sooner had I reached the place where one</l>
		<l>could hear a murmur, like a beehive&apos;s hum,</l>
		<l>of waters as they fell to the next circle,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when, setting out together, three shades ran,</l>
		<l>leaving another company that passed</l>
		<l>beneath the rain of bitter punishment.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>They came toward us, and each of them cried out:</l>
		<l>&quot;Stop, you who by your clothing seem to be</l>
		<l>someone who comes from our indecent country!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Ah me, what wounds I saw upon their limbs,</l>
		<l>wounds new and old, wounds that the flames seared </l>
		<l>It pains me still as I remember it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When they cried out, my master paid attention;</l>
		<l>he turned his face toward me and then he said:</l>
		<l>&quot;Now wait: to these one must show courtesy.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And were it not the nature of this place</l>
		<l>for shafts of fire to fall, I&apos;d say that haste</l>
		<l>was seemlier for you than for those three.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As soon as we stood still, they started up</l>
		<l>their ancient wail again; and when they reached us</l>
		<l>they formed a wheel, all three of them together.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As champions, naked, oiled, will always do,</l>
		<l>each studying the grip that serves him best</l>
		<l>before the blows and wounds begin to fall,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>while wheeling so, each one made sure his face</l>
		<l>was turned to me, so that their necks opposed</l>
		<l>their feet in one uninterrupted flow.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And, &quot;If the squalor of this shifting sand,</l>
		<l>together with our baked and barren features,</l>
		<l>makes us and our requests contemptible,&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>one said, &quot;then may our fame incline your mind</l>
		<l>to tell us who you are, whose living feet</l>
		<l>can make their way through Hell with such assurance</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He in whose steps you see me tread, although</l>
		<l>he now must wheel about both peeled and naked,</l>
		<l>was higher in degree than you believe:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he was a grandson of the good Gualdrada,</l>
		<l>and Guido Guerra was his name; in life</l>
		<l>his sword and his good sense accomplished much.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The other who, behind me, tramples sand-</l>
		<l>Tegghiaio Aldobrandi, one whose voice</l>
		<l>should have been heeded in the world above.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I, who share this punishment with them,</l>
		<l>was Jacopo Rusticucci; certainly,</l>
		<l>more than all else, my savage wife destroyed me.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If I&apos;d had shield and shelter from the fire,</l>
		<l>I should have thrown myself down there among them-</l>
		<l>I think my master would have sanctioned that;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but since that would have left me burned and baked</l>
		<l>my fear won out against the good intention</l>
		<l>that made me so impatient to embrace them.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I began: &quot;Your present state had fixed</l>
		<l>not scorn but sorrow in me-and so deeply</l>
		<l>that it will only disappear slowly-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>as soon as my lord spoke to me with words</l>
		<l>that made me understand what kind of men</l>
		<l>were coming toward us, men of worth like yours.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For I am of your city; and with fondness,</l>
		<l>I&apos;ve always told and heard the others tell</l>
		<l>of both your actions and your honored names.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I leave the gall and go for the sweet apples</l>
		<l>that I was promised by my truthful guide;</l>
		<l>but first I must descend into the center.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;So may your soul long lead your limbs and may</l>
		<l>your fame shine after you,&quot; he answered then,</l>
		<l>&quot;tell us if courtesy and valor still</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>abide within our city as they did</l>
		<l>when we were there, or have they disappeared</l>
		<l>completely; for Guiglielmo Borsiere,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>who only recently has come to share</l>
		<l>our torments, and goes there with our companions,</l>
		<l>has caused us much affliction with his words.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Newcomers to the city and quick gains</l>
		<l>have brought excess and arrogance to you,</l>
		<l>o Florence, and you weep for it already!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So I cried out with face upraised; the three</l>
		<l>looked at each other when they heard my answer</l>
		<l>as men will stare when they have heard the truth.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;If you can always offer a reply</l>
		<l>so readily to others,&quot; said all three,</l>
		<l>&quot;then happy you who speak, at will, so clearly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So, if you can escape these lands of darkness</l>
		<l>and see the lovely stars on your return,</l>
		<l>when you repeat with pleasure, &apos;I was there,&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>be sure that you remember us to men.&quot;</l>
		<l>At this they broke their wheel; and as they fled,</l>
		<l>their swift legs seemed to be no less than wings.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The time it took for them to disappear-</l>
		<l>more brief than time it takes to say &quot;amen&quot;;</l>
		<l>and so, my master thought it right to leave.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I followed him. We&apos;d only walked a little</l>
		<l>when roaring water grew so near to us</l>
		<l>we hardly could have heard each other speak.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And even as the river that is first</l>
		<l>to take its own course eastward from Mount Viso,</l>
		<l>along the left flank of the Apennines</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>(which up above is called the Acquacheta,</l>
		<l>before it spills into its valley bed</l>
		<l>and flows without that name beyond Forli),</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>reverberates above San Benedetto</l>
		<l>dell&apos;Alpe as it cascades in one leap,</l>
		<l>where there is space enough to house a thousand;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so did we hear that blackened water roar</l>
		<l>as it plunged down a steep and craggy bank,</l>
		<l>enough to deafen us in a few hours.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Around my waist I had a cord as girdle,</l>
		<l>and with it once I thought I should be able</l>
		<l>to catch the leopard with the painted hide.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And after I had loosened it completely,</l>
		<l>just as my guide commanded me to do,</l>
		<l>I handed it to him, knotted and coiled.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this, he wheeled around upon his right</l>
		<l>and cast it, at some distance from the edge,</l>
		<l>straight down into the depth of the ravine.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;And surely something strange must here reply,&quot;</l>
		<l>I said within myself, &quot;to this strange sign-</l>
		<l>the sign my master follows with his eye.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Ah, how much care men ought to exercise</l>
		<l>with those whose penetrating intellect</l>
		<l>can see our thoughts-not just our outer act!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He said to me: &quot;Now there will soon emerge</l>
		<l>what I await and what your thought has conjured:</l>
		<l>it soon must be discovered to your sight.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Faced with that truth which seems a lie, a man</l>
		<l>should always close his lips as long as he can-</l>
		<l>to tell it shames him, even though he&apos;s blameless;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but here I can&apos;t be still; and by the lines</l>
		<l>of this my Comedy, reader, I swear-</l>
		<l>and may my verse find favor for long years-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that through the dense and darkened air I saw</l>
		<l>a figure swimming, rising up, enough</l>
		<l>to bring amazement to the firmest heart,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>like one returning from the waves where he</l>
		<l>went down to loose an anchor snagged upon</l>
		<l>a reef or something else hid in the sea,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>who stretches upward and draws in his feet.</l>
