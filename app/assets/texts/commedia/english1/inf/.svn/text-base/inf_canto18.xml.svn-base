	<p>
		<l>There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,</l>
		<l>made all of stone the color of crude iron,</l>
		<l>as is the wall that makes its way around it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Right in the middle of this evil field</l>
		<l>is an abyss, a broad and yawning pit,</l>
		<l>whose structure I shall tell in its due place.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The belt, then, that extends between the pit</l>
		<l>and that hard, steep wall&apos;s base is circular;</l>
		<l>its bottom has been split into ten valleys.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as, where moat on moat surrounds a castle</l>
		<l>in order to keep guard upon the walls,</l>
		<l>the ground they occupy will form a pattern,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so did the valleys here form a design;</l>
		<l>and as such fortresses have bridges running</l>
		<l>right from their thresholds toward the outer bank,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so here, across the banks and ditches, ridges</l>
		<l>ran from the base of that rock wall until</l>
		<l>the pit that cuts them short and joins them all.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This was the place in which we found ourselves</l>
		<l>when Geryon had put us down; the poet</l>
		<l>held to the left, and I walked at his back.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Upon the right I saw new misery,</l>
		<l>I saw new tortures and new torturers,</l>
		<l>filling the first of Malebolge&apos;s moats.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Along its bottom, naked sinners moved,</l>
		<l>to our side of the middle, facing us;</l>
		<l>beyond that, they moved with us, but more quickly-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>as, in the year of Jubilee, the Romans,</l>
		<l>confronted by great crowds, contrived a plan</l>
		<l>that let the people pass across the bridge,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for to one side went all who had their eyes</l>
		<l>upon the Castle, heading toward St. Peter&apos;s,</l>
		<l>and to the other, those who faced the Mount.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Both left and right, along the somber rock,</l>
		<l>I saw horned demons with enormous whips,</l>
		<l>who lashed those spirits cruelly from behind.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Ah, how their first strokes made those sinners lift</l>
		<l>their heels! Indeed no sinner waited for</l>
		<l>a second stroke to fall-or for a third.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And as I moved ahead, my eyes met those</l>
		<l>of someone else, and suddenly I said:</l>
		<l>&quot;I was not spared the sight of him before.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And so I stayed my steps, to study him;</l>
		<l>my gentle guide had stopped together with me</l>
		<l>and gave me leave to take a few steps back.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That scourged soul thought that he could hide himself</l>
		<l>by lowering his face; it helped him little,</l>
		<l>for I said: &quot;You, who cast your eyes upon</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the ground, if these your features are not false,</l>
		<l>must be Venedico Caccianemico;</l>
		<l>but what brings you to sauces so piquant?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;I speak unwillingly;</l>
		<l>but your plain speech, that brings the memory</l>
		<l>of the old world to me, is what compels me;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For it was I who led Ghisolabella</l>
		<l>to do as the Marquis would have her do-</l>
		<l>however they retell that filthy tale.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I&apos;m not the only Bolognese who weeps here;</l>
		<l>indeed, this place is so crammed full of us</l>
		<l>that not so many tongues have learned to say</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>sipa between the Savena and Reno;</l>
		<l>if you want faith and testament of that,</l>
		<l>just call to mind our avaricious hearts.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And as he spoke, a demon cudgeled him</l>
		<l>with his horsewhip and cried: &quot;Be off, you pimp,</l>
		<l>there are no women here for you to trick.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I joined my escort once again; and then</l>
		<l>with but few steps, we came upon a place</l>
		<l>where, from the bank, a rocky ridge ran out.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We climbed quite easily along that height;</l>
		<l>and turning right upon its jagged back,</l>
		<l>we took our leave of those eternal circlings.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When we had reached the point where that ridge opens</l>
		<l>below to leave a passage for the lashed,</l>
		<l>my guide said: &quot;Stay, and make sure that the sight</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of still more ill-born spirits strikes your eyes,</l>
		<l>for you have not yet seen their faces, since</l>
		<l>they have been moving in our own direction.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>From the old bridge we looked down at the ranks</l>
		<l>of those approaching from the other side;</l>
		<l>they too were driven onward by the lash.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And my good master, though I had not asked,</l>
		<l>urged me: &quot;Look at that mighty one who comes</l>
		<l>and does not seem to shed a tear of pain:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>how he still keeps the image of a king!</l>
		<l>That shade is Jason, who with heart and head</l>
		<l>deprived the men of Colchis of their ram.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He made a landfall on the isle of Lemnos</l>
		<l>after its women, bold and pitiless,</l>
		<l>had given all their island males to death.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>With polished words and love signs he took in</l>
		<l>Hypsipyle, the girl whose own deception</l>
		<l>had earlier deceived the other women.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he abandoned her, alone and pregnant;</l>
		<l>such guilt condemns him to such punishment;</l>
		<l>and for Medea, too, revenge is taken.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>With him go those who cheated so: this is</l>
		<l>enough for you to know of that first valley</l>
		<l>and of the souls it clamps within its jaws.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We were already where the narrow path</l>
		<l>reaches and intersects the second bank</l>
		<l>and serves as shoulder for another bridge.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We heard the people whine in the next pouch</l>
		<l>and heard them as they snorted with their snouts;</l>
		<l>we heard them use their palms to beat themselves.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And exhalations, rising from below,</l>
		<l>stuck to the banks, encrusting them with mold,</l>
		<l>and so waged war against both eyes and nose.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The bottom is so deep, we found no spot</l>
		<l>to see it from, except by climbing up</l>
		<l>the arch until the bridge&apos;s highest point.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This was the place we reached; the ditch beneath</l>
		<l>held people plunged in excrement that seemed</l>
		<l>as if it had been poured from human privies.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And while my eyes searched that abysmal sight,</l>
		<l>I saw one with a head so smeared with shit,</l>
		<l>one could not see if he were lay or cleric.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He howled: &quot;Why do you stare more greedily</l>
		<l>at me than at the others who are filthy?&quot;</l>
		<l>And I: &quot;Because, if I remember right,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I have seen you before, with your hair dry;</l>
		<l>and so I eye you more than all: you are</l>
		<l>Alessio Interminei of Lucca.&quot;&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then he continued, pounding on his pate:</l>
		<l>&quot;I am plunged here because of flatteries-</l>
		<l>of which my tongue had such sufficiency.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At which my guide advised me: &quot;See you thrust</l>
		<l>your head a little farther to the front,</l>
		<l>so that your eyes can clearly glimpse the face</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of that besmirched, bedraggled harridan</l>
		<l>who scratches at herself with shit-filled nails,</l>
		<l>and now she crouches, now she stands upright.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That is Thais, the harlot who returned</l>
		<l>her lover&apos;s question, &apos;Are you very grateful</l>
		<l>to me?&apos; by saying, &apos;Yes, enormously.&apos;&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And now our sight has had its fill of this.&quot;</l>
	</p>
