		<l>When he had finished with his words, the thief</l>
		<l>raised high his fists with both figs cocked and cried</l>
		<l>&quot;Take that, o God; I square them off for you!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>From that time on, those serpents were my friends,</l>
		<l>for one of them coiled then around his neck,</l>
		<l>as if to say, &quot;I&apos;ll have you speak no more&quot;;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>another wound about his arms and bound him</l>
		<l>again and wrapped itself in front so firmly,</l>
		<l>he could not even make them budge an inch.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Pistoia, ah, Pistoia, must you last:</l>
		<l>why not decree your self-incineration,</l>
		<l>since you surpass your seed in wickedness?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Throughout the shadowed circles of deep Hell,</l>
		<l>I saw no soul against God so rebel,</l>
		<l>not even he who fell from Theban walls.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He fled and could not say another word;</l>
		<l>and then I saw a Centaur full of anger,</l>
		<l>shouting: &quot;Where is he, where&apos;s that bitter one?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I do not think Maremma has the number</l>
		<l>of snakes that Centaur carried on his haunch</l>
		<l>until the part that takes our human form.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Upon his shoulders and behind his nape</l>
		<l>there lay a dragon with its wings outstretched;</l>
		<l>it sets ablaze all those it intercepts.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My master said: &quot;That Centaur there is Cacus,</l>
		<l>who often made a lake of blood within</l>
		<l>a grotto underneath Mount Aventine.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He does not ride the same road as his brothers</l>
		<l>because he stole-and most deceitfully-</l>
		<l>from the great herd nearby; his crooked deeds</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>ended beneath the club of Hercules,</l>
		<l>who may have given him a hundred blows-</l>
		<l>but he was not alive to feel the tenth.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>While he was talking so, Cacus ran by</l>
		<l>and, just beneath our ledge, three souls arrived;</l>
		<l>but neither I nor my guide noticed them</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>until they had cried out: &quot;And who are you?&quot;</l>
		<l>At this the words we shared were interrupted,</l>
		<l>and we attended only to those spirits.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I did not recognize them, but it happened,</l>
		<l>as chance will usually bring about,</l>
		<l>that one of them called out the other&apos;s name,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>exclaiming: &quot;Where was Cianfa left behind?&quot;</l>
		<l>At this, so that my guide might be alert,</l>
		<l>I raised my finger up from chin to nose.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If, reader, you are slow now to believe</l>
		<l>what I shall tell, that is no cause for wonder,</l>
		<l>for I who saw it hardly can accept it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As I kept my eyes fixed upon those sinners,</l>
		<l>a serpent with six feet springs out against</l>
		<l>one of the three, and clutches him completely.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It gripped his belly with its middle feet,</l>
		<l>and with its forefeet grappled his two arms;</l>
		<l>and then it sank its teeth in both his cheeks;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>it stretched its rear feet out along his thighs</l>
		<l>and ran its tail along between the two,</l>
		<l>then straightened it again behind his loins.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No ivy ever gripped a tree so fast</l>
		<l>as when that horrifying monster clasped</l>
		<l>and intertwined the other&apos;s limbs with its.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then just as if their substance were warm wax,</l>
		<l>they stuck together and they mixed their colors,</l>
		<l>so neither seemed what he had been before;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>just as, when paper&apos;s kindled, where it still</l>
		<l>has not caught flame in full, its color&apos;s dark</l>
		<l>though not yet black, while white is dying off.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The other two souls stared, and each one cried:</l>
		<l>&quot;Ah me, Agnello, how you change! Just see,</l>
		<l>you are already neither two nor one!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then two heads were already joined in one,</l>
		<l>when in one face where two had been dissolved,</l>
		<l>two intermingled shapes appeared to us.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Two arms came into being from four lengths;</l>
		<l>the thighs and legs, the belly and the chest</l>
		<l>became such limbs as never had been seen.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And every former shape was canceled there:</l>
		<l>that perverse image seemed to share in both-</l>
		<l>and none; and so, and slowly, it moved on.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as the lizard, when it darts from hedge</l>
		<l>to hedge, beneath the dog days&apos; giant lash,</l>
		<l>seems, if it cross one&apos;s path, a lightning flash,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so seemed a blazing little serpent moving</l>
		<l>against the bellies of the other two,</l>
		<l>as black and livid as a peppercorn.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Attacking one of therm, it pierced right through</l>
		<l>the part where we first take our nourishment;</l>
		<l>and then it fell before him at full length.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The one it had transfixed stared but said nothing;</l>
		<l>in fact he only stood his ground and yawned</l>
		<l>as one whom sleep or fever has undone.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The serpent stared at him, he at the serpent;</l>
		<l>one through his wound, the other through his mouth</l>
		<l>were smoking violently; their smoke met.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Let Lucan now be silent, where he sings</l>
		<l>of sad Sabellus and Nasidius,</l>
		<l>and wait to hear what flies off from my bow.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Let Ovid now be silent, where he tells</l>
		<l>of Cadmus, Arethusa; if his verse</l>
		<l>has made of one a serpent, one a fountain,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I do not envy him; he never did</l>
		<l>transmute two natures, face to face, so that</l>
		<l>both forms were ready to exchange their matter.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These were the ways they answered to each other:</l>
		<l>the serpent split its tail into a fork;</l>
		<l>the wounded sinner drew his steps together.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The legs and then the thighs along with them</l>
		<l>so fastened to each other that the juncture</l>
		<l>soon left no sign that was discernible.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Meanwhile the cleft tail took upon itself</l>
		<l>the form the other gradually lost;</l>
		<l>its skin grew soft, the other&apos;s skin grew hard.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw the arms that drew in at his armpits</l>
		<l>and also saw the monster&apos;s two short feet</l>
		<l>grow long for just as much as those were shortened</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The serpent&apos;s hind feet, twisted up together,</l>
		<l>became the member that man hides; just as</l>
		<l>the wretch put out two hind paws from his member.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And while the smoke veils each with a new color,</l>
		<l>and now breeds hair upon the skin of one,</l>
		<l>just as it strips the hair from off the other,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the one rose up, the other fell; and yet</l>
		<l>they never turned aside their impious eyelamps,</l>
		<l>beneath which each of them transformed his snout:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he who stood up drew his back toward the temples,</l>
		<l>and from the excess matter growing there</l>
		<l>came ears upon the cheeks that had been bare;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>whatever had not been pulled back but kept,</l>
		<l>superfluous, then made his face a nose</l>
		<l>and thickened out his lips appropriately.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He who was lying down thrust out his snout;</l>
		<l>and even as the snail hauls in its horns,</l>
		<l>he drew his ears straight back into his head;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>his tongue, which had before been whole and fit</l>
		<l>for speech, now cleaves; the other&apos;s tongue, which</l>
		<l>been forked, now closes up; and the smoke stops.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The soul that had become an animal,</l>
		<l>now hissing, hurried off along the valley;</l>
		<l>the other one, behind him, speaks and spits.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then he turned aside his new-made shoulders</l>
		<l>and told the third soul: &quot;I&apos;d have Buoso run</l>
		<l>on all fours down this road, as I have done.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And so I saw the seventh ballast change</l>
		<l>and rechange; may the strangeness plead for me</l>
		<l>if there&apos;s been some confusion in my pen.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And though my eyes were somewhat blurred, my mind</l>
		<l>bewildered, those three sinners did not flee</l>
		<l>so secretly that I could not perceive</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Puccio Sciancato clearly, he who was</l>
		<l>the only soul who&apos;d not been changed among</l>
		<l>the three companions we had met at first;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the other one made you, Gaville, grieve.</l>
