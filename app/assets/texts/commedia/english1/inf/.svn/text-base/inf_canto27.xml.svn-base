		<l>The flame already was erect and silent-</l>
		<l>it had no more to say. Now it had left us</l>
		<l>with the permission of the gentle poet,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when, just behind it, came another flame</l>
		<l>that drew our eyes to watch its tip because</l>
		<l>of the perplexing sound that it sent forth.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even as the Sicilian bull (that first</l>
		<l>had bellowed with the cry-and this was just-</l>
		<l>of him who shaped it with his instruments)</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>would always bellow with its victim&apos;s voice,</l>
		<l>so that, although that bull was only brass,</l>
		<l>it seemed as if it were pierced through by pain;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so were the helpless words that, from the first,</l>
		<l>had found no path or exit from the flame,</l>
		<l>transformed into the language of the fire.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But after they had found their way up toward</l>
		<l>the tip, and given it that movement which</l>
		<l>the tongue had given them along their passage,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>we heard: &quot;O you to whom I turn my voice,</l>
		<l>who only now were talking Lombard, saying,</l>
		<l>&apos;Now you may leave-I&apos;ll not provoke more speech,&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>though I have come perhaps a little late,</l>
		<l>may it not trouble you to stop and speak</l>
		<l>with me; see how I stay-and I am burning!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If you have fallen into this blind world</l>
		<l>but recently, out of the sweet Italian</l>
		<l>country from which I carry all my guilt,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>do tell me if the Romagnoles have peace</l>
		<l>or war; I was from there-the hills between</l>
		<l>Urbino and the ridge where Tiber springs.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I still was bent, attentive, over him,</l>
		<l>when my guide nudged me lightly at the side</l>
		<l>and said: &quot;You speak; he is Italian.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I, who had my answer set already,</l>
		<l>without delay began to speak to him:</l>
		<l>&quot;O soul that is concealed below in flame,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Romagna is not now and never was</l>
		<l>quite free of war inside its tyrants&apos; hearts;</l>
		<l>but when I left her, none had broken out.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Ravenna stands as it has stood for years;</l>
		<l>the eagle of Polenta shelters it</l>
		<l>and also covers Cervia with his wings.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The city that already stood long trial</l>
		<l>and made a bloody heap out of the French,</l>
		<l>now finds itself again beneath green paws.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Both mastiffs of Verruchio, old and new,</l>
		<l>who dealt so badly with Montagna, use</l>
		<l>thier teeth to bore where they have always gnawed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The cities on Lamone and Santerno</l>
		<l>are led by the young lion of the white lair;</l>
		<l>from summer unto winter, he shifts factions.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That city with its side bathed by the Savio,</l>
		<l>just as it lies between the plain and mountain,</l>
		<l>lives somewhere between tyranny and freedom.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And now, I pray you, tell me who you are:</l>
		<l>do not be harder than I&apos;ve been with you,</l>
		<l>that in the world your name may still endure.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>After the flame, in customary fashion,</l>
		<l>had roared awhile, it moved its pointed tip</l>
		<l>this side and that and then set free this breath:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;If I thought my reply were meant for one</l>
		<l>who ever could return into the world,</l>
		<l>this flame would stir no more; and yet, since none</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>if what I hear is true-ever returned</l>
		<l>alive from this abyss, then without fear</l>
		<l>of facing infamy, I answer you.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I was a man of arms, then wore the cord,</l>
		<l>believing that, so girt, I made amends;</l>
		<l>and surely what I thought would have been true</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>had not the Highest Priest-may he be damned!-</l>
		<l>made me fall back into my former sins;</l>
		<l>and how and why, I&apos;d have you hear from me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>While I still had the form of bones and flesh</l>
		<l>my mother gave to me, my deeds were not</l>
		<l>those of the lion but those of the fox.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The wiles and secret ways-I knew them all</l>
		<l>and so employed their arts that my renown</l>
		<l>had reached the very boundaries of earth.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But when I saw myself come to that part</l>
		<l>of life when it is fitting for all men</l>
		<l>to lower sails and gather in their ropes,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>what once had been my joy was now dejection;</l>
		<l>repenting and confessing, I became</l>
		<l>a friar; and- poor me-it would have helped.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The prince of the new Pharisees, who then</l>
		<l>was waging war so near the Lateran-</l>
		<l>and not against the Jews or Saracens,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for every enemy of his was Christian,</l>
		<l>and none of them had gone to conquer Acre</l>
		<l>or been a trader in the Sultan&apos;s lands-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>took no care for the highest office or</l>
		<l>the holy orders that were his, or for</l>
		<l>my cord, which used to make its wearers leaner.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But just as Constantine, on Mount Soracte,</l>
		<l>to cure his leprosy, sought out Sylvester,</l>
		<l>so this one sought me out as his instructor,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to ease the fever of his arrogance.</l>
		<l>He asked me to give counsel. I was silent-</l>
		<l>his words had seemed to me delirious.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then he said: &apos;Your heart must not mistrust:</l>
		<l>I now absolve you in advance-teach me</l>
		<l>to batter Penestrino to the ground.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You surely know that I possess the power</l>
		<l>to lock and unlock Heaven; for the keys</l>
		<l>my predecessor did not prize are two.&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then his grave arguments compelled me so,</l>
		<l>my silence seemed a worse offense than speech,</l>
		<l>and I said: &apos;Since you cleanse me of the sin</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that I must now fall into, Father, know:</l>
		<l>long promises and very brief fulfillments</l>
		<l>will bring a victory to your high throne.&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then Francis came, as soon as I was dead,</l>
		<l>for me; but one of the black cherubim</l>
		<l>told him: &apos;Don&apos;t bear him off; do not cheat me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He must come down among my menials;</l>
		<l>the counsel that he gave was fraudulent;</l>
		<l>since then, I&apos;ve kept close track, to snatch his scalp</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>one can&apos;t absolve a man who&apos;s not repented,</l>
		<l>and no one can repent and will at once;</l>
		<l>the law of contradiction won&apos;t allow it.&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O miserable me, for how I started</l>
		<l>when he took hold of me and said: &apos;Perhaps</l>
		<l>you did not think that I was a logician!&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He carried me to Minos; and that monster</l>
		<l>twisted his tail eight times around his hide</l>
		<l>and then, when he had bit it in great anger,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>announced: &apos;This one is for the thieving fire&apos;;</l>
		<l>for which-and where, you see-I now am lost,</l>
		<l>and in this garb I move in bitterness.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And when, with this, his words were at an end,</l>
		<l>the flame departed, sorrowing and writhing</l>
		<l>and tossing its sharp horn. We moved beyond;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I went together with my guide, along</l>
		<l>the ridge until the other arch that bridges</l>
		<l>the ditch where payment is imposed on those</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>who, since they brought such discord, bear such loads.</l>
