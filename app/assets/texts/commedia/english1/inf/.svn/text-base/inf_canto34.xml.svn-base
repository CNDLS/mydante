		<l>&quot;Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni</l>
		<l>toward us; and therefore keep your eyes ahead,&quot;</l>
		<l>my master said, &quot;to see if you can spy him.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as, when night falls on our hemisphere</l>
		<l>or when a heavy fog is blowing thick,</l>
		<l>a windmill seems to wheel when seen far off,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so then I seemed to see that sort of structure.</l>
		<l>And next, because the wind was strong, I shrank</l>
		<l>behind my guide; there was no other shelter.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And now-with fear I set it down in meter-</l>
		<l>I was where all the shades were fully covered</l>
		<l>but visible as wisps of straw in glass.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There some lie flat and others stand erect,</l>
		<l>one on his head, and one upon his soles;</l>
		<l>and some bend face to feet, just like a bow.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But after we had made our way ahead,</l>
		<l>my master felt he now should have me see</l>
		<l>that creature who was once a handsome presence;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he stepped aside and made me stop, and said:</l>
		<l>&quot;Look! Here is Dis, and this the place where you</l>
		<l>will have to arm yourself with fortitude.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O reader, do not ask of me how I</l>
		<l>grew faint and frozen then-I cannot write it:</l>
		<l>all words would fall far short of what it was.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I did not die, and I was not alive;</l>
		<l>think for yourself, if you have any wit,</l>
		<l>what I became, deprived of life and death.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The emperor of the despondent kingdom</l>
		<l>so towered from the ice, up from midchest,</l>
		<l>that I match better with a giant&apos;s breadth</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>than giants match the measure of his arms;</l>
		<l>now you can gauge the size of all of him</l>
		<l>if it is in proportion to such parts.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If he was once as handsome as he now</l>
		<l>is ugly and, despite that, raised his brows</l>
		<l>against his Maker, one can understand</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>how every sorrow has its source in him!</l>
		<l>I marveled when I saw that, on his head,</l>
		<l>he had three faces: one-in front-bloodred;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and then another two that, just above</l>
		<l>the midpoint of each shoulder, joined the first;</l>
		<l>and at the crown, all three were reattached;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the right looked somewhat yellow, somewhat white;</l>
		<l>the left in its appearance was like those</l>
		<l>who come from where the Nile, descending, flows.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Beneath each face of his, two wings spread out,</l>
		<l>as broad as suited so immense a bird:</l>
		<l>I&apos;ve never seen a ship with sails so wide.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>They had no feathers, but were fashioned like</l>
		<l>a bat&apos;s; and he was agitating them,</l>
		<l>so that three winds made their way out from him-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and all Cocytus froze before those winds.</l>
		<l>He wept out of six eyes; and down three chins,</l>
		<l>tears gushed together with a bloody froth.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Within each mouth-he used it like a grinder-</l>
		<l>with gnashing teeth he tore to bits a sinner,</l>
		<l>so that he brought much pain to three at once.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The forward sinner found that biting nothing</l>
		<l>when matched against the clawing, for at times</l>
		<l>his back was stripped completely of its hide.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;That soul up there who has to suffer most,&quot;</l>
		<l>my master said: &quot;Judas Iscariot-</l>
		<l>his head inside, he jerks his legs without.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Of those two others, with their heads beneath,</l>
		<l>the one who hangs from that black snout is Brutus-</l>
		<l>see how he writhes and does not say a word!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That other, who seems so robust, is Cassius.</l>
		<l>But night is come again, and it is time</l>
		<l>for us to leave; we have seen everything.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as he asked, I clasped him round the neck;</l>
		<l>and he watched for the chance of time and place,</l>
		<l>and when the wings were open wide enough,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he took fast hold upon the shaggy flanks</l>
		<l>and then descended, down from tuft to tuft,</l>
		<l>between the tangled hair and icy crusts.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When we had reached the point at which the thigh</l>
		<l>revolves, just at the swelling of the hip,</l>
		<l>my guide, with heavy strain and rugged work,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>reversed his head to where his legs had been</l>
		<l>and grappled on the hair, as one who climbs-</l>
		<l>I thought that we were going back to Hell.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Hold tight,&quot; my master said-he panted like</l>
		<l>a man exhausted-&quot;it is by such stairs</l>
		<l>that we must take our leave of so much evil.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then he slipped through a crevice in a rock</l>
		<l>and placed me on the edge of it, to sit;</l>
		<l>that done, he climbed toward me with steady steps.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I raised my eyes, believing I should see</l>
		<l>the half of Lucifer that I had left;</l>
		<l>instead I saw him with his legs turned up;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and if I then became perplexed, do let</l>
		<l>the ignorant be judges-those who can</l>
		<l>not understand what point I had just crossed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Get up,&quot; my master said, &quot;be on your feet:</l>
		<l>the way is long, the path is difficult;</l>
		<l>the sun&apos;s already back to middle tierce.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It was no palace hall, the place in which</l>
		<l>we found ourselves, but with its rough-hewn floor</l>
		<l>and scanty light, a dungeon built by nature.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Before I free myself from this abyss,</l>
		<l>master,&quot; I said when I had stood up straight,</l>
		<l>&quot;tell me enough to see I don&apos;t mistake:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Where is the ice? And how is he so placed</l>
		<l>head downward? Tell me, too, how has the sun</l>
		<l>in so few hours gone from night to morning?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;You still believe you are</l>
		<l>north of the center, where I grasped the hair</l>
		<l>of the damned worm who pierces through the world.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And you were there as long as I descended;</l>
		<l>but when I turned, that&apos;s when you passed the point</l>
		<l>to which, from every part, all weights are drawn.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And now you stand beneath the hemisphere</l>
		<l>opposing that which cloaks the great dry lands</l>
		<l>and underneath whose zenith died the Man</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>whose birth and life were sinless in this world.</l>
		<l>Your feet are placed upon a little sphere</l>
		<l>that forms the other face of the Judecca.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Here it is morning when it&apos;s evening there;</l>
		<l>and he whose hair has served us as a ladder</l>
		<l>is still fixed, even as he was before.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This was the side on which he fell from Heaven;</l>
		<l>for fear of him, the land that once loomed here</l>
		<l>made of the sea a veil and rose into</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>our hemisphere; and that land which appears</l>
		<l>upon this side-perhaps to flee from him-</l>
		<l>left here this hollow space and hurried upward.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There is a place below, the limit of</l>
		<l>that cave, its farthest point from Beelzebub,</l>
		<l>a place one cannot see: it is discovered</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>by ear-there is a sounding stream that flows</l>
		<l>along the hollow of a rock eroded</l>
		<l>by winding waters, and the slope is easy.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My guide and I came on that hidden road</l>
		<l>to make our way back into the bright world;</l>
		<l>and with no care for any rest, we climbed-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he first, I following-until I saw,</l>
		<l>through a round opening, some of those things</l>
		<l>of beauty Heaven bears. It was from there</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that we emerged, to see-once more-the stars.</l>
