	<p>
		<l>So I descended from the first enclosure</l>
		<l>down to the second circle, that which girdles</l>
		<l>less space but grief more great, that goads to weep</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There dreadful Minos stands, gnashing his teeth:</l>
		<l>examining the sins of those who enter,</l>
		<l>he judges and assigns as his tail twines.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I mean that when the spirit born to evil</l>
		<l>appears before him, it confesses all;</l>
		<l>and he, the connoisseur of sin, can tell</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the depth in Hell appropriate to it;</l>
		<l>as many times as Minos wraps his tail</l>
		<l>around himself, that marks the sinner&apos;s level.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Always there is a crowd that stands before him:</l>
		<l>each soul in turn advances toward that judgment;</l>
		<l>they speak and hear, then they are cast below.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Arresting his extraordinary task,</l>
		<l>Minos, as soon as he had seen me, said:</l>
		<l>&quot;O you who reach this house of suffering,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>be careful how you enter, whom you trust;</l>
		<l>the gate is wide, but do not be deceived!&quot;</l>
		<l>To which my guide replied: &quot;But why protest?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Do not attempt to block his fated path:</l>
		<l>our passage has been willed above, where One</l>
		<l>can do what He has willed; and ask no more.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now notes of desperation have begun</l>
		<l>to overtake my hearing; now I come</l>
		<l>where mighty lamentation beats against me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I reached a place where every light is muted,</l>
		<l>which bellows like the sea beneath a tempest,</l>
		<l>when it is battered by opposing winds.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The hellish hurricane, which never rests,</l>
		<l>drives on the spirits with its violence:</l>
		<l>wheeling and pounding, it harasses them.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When they come up against the ruined slope,</l>
		<l>then there are cries and wailing and lament,</l>
		<l>and there they curse the force of the divine.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I learned that those who undergo this torment</l>
		<l>are damned because they sinned within the flesh,</l>
		<l>subjecting reason to the rule of lust.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And as, in the cold season, starlings&apos; wings</l>
		<l>bear them along in broad and crowded ranks</l>
		<l>so does that blast bear on the guilty spirits:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>now here, now there, now down, now up, it drives t</l>
		<l>There is no hope that ever comforts them-</l>
		<l>no hope for rest and none for lesser pain.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And just as cranes in flight will chant their lays</l>
		<l>arraying their long file across the air,</l>
		<l>so did the shades I saw approaching, borne</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>by that assailing wind, lament and moan;</l>
		<l>so that I asked him: &quot;Master, who are those</l>
		<l>who suffer punishment in this dark air?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;The first of those about whose history</l>
		<l>you want to know,&quot; my master then told me</l>
		<l>&quot;once ruled as empress over many nations.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Her vice of lust became so customary</l>
		<l>that she made license licit in her laws</l>
		<l>to free her from the scandal she had caused.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>She is Semiramis, of whom we read</l>
		<l>that she was Ninus&apos; wife and his successor:</l>
		<l>she held the land the Sultan now commands.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That other spirit killed herself for love,</l>
		<l>and she betrayed the ashes of Sychaeus;</l>
		<l>the wanton Cleopatra follows next.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>See Helen, for whose sake so many years</l>
		<l>of evil had to pass; see great Achilles,</l>
		<l>who finally met love-in his last battle.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>See Paris, Tristan . . .&quot;-and he pointed out</l>
		<l>and named to me more than a thousand shades</l>
		<l>departed from our life because of love.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No sooner had I heard my teacher name</l>
		<l>the ancient ladies and the knights, than pity</l>
		<l>seized me, and I was like a man astray.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My first words: &quot;Poet, I should willingly</l>
		<l>speak with those two who go together there</l>
		<l>and seem so lightly carried by the wind.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;You&apos;ll see when they draw closer</l>
		<l>to us, and then you may appeal to them</l>
		<l>by that love which impels them. They will come.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No sooner had the wind bent them toward us</l>
		<l>than I urged on my voice: &quot;O battered souls</l>
		<l>if One does not forbid it, speak with us.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even as doves when summoned by desire,</l>
		<l>borne forward by their will, move through the air</l>
		<l>with wings uplifted, still, to their sweet nest,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>those spirits left the ranks where Dido suffers</l>
		<l>approaching us through the malignant air;</l>
		<l>so powerful had been my loving cry.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O living being, gracious and benign,</l>
		<l>who through the darkened air have come to visit</l>
		<l>our souls that stained the world with blood, if He</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>who rules the universe were friend to us</l>
		<l>then we should pray to Him to give you peace</l>
		<l>for you have pitied our atrocious state.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Whatever pleases you to hear and speak</l>
		<l>will please us, too, to hear and speak with you,</l>
		<l>now while the wind is silent, in this place.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The land where I was born lies on that shore</l>
		<l>to which the Po together with the waters</l>
		<l>that follow it descends to final rest.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Love, that can quickly seize the gentle heart,</l>
		<l>took hold of him because of the fair body</l>
		<l>taken from me-how that was done still wounds me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Love, that releases no beloved from loving,</l>
		<l>took hold of me so strongly through his beauty</l>
		<l>that, as you see, it has not left me yet.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Love led the two of us unto one death.</l>
		<l>Caina waits for him who took our life.&quot;</l>
		<l>These words were borne across from them to us.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When I had listened to those injured souls,</l>
		<l>I bent my head and held it low until</l>
		<l>the poet asked of me: &quot;What are you thinking?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When I replied, my words began: &quot;Alas,</l>
		<l>how many gentle thoughts, how deep a longing,</l>
		<l>had led them to the agonizing pass!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I addressed my speech again to them,</l>
		<l>and I began: &quot;Francesca, your afflictions</l>
		<l>move me to tears of sorrow and of pity.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But tell me, in the time of gentle sighs,</l>
		<l>with what and in what way did Love allow you</l>
		<l>to recognize your still uncertain longings?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And she to me: &quot;There is no greater sorrow</l>
		<l>than thinking back upon a happy time</l>
		<l>in misery-and this your teacher knows.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Yet if you long so much to understand</l>
		<l>the first root of our love, then I shall tell</l>
		<l>my tale to you as one who weeps and speaks.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>One day, to pass the time away, we read</l>
		<l>of Lancelot-how love had overcome him.</l>
		<l>We were alone, and we suspected nothing.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And time and time again that reading led</l>
		<l>our eyes to meet, and made our faces pale,</l>
		<l>and yet one point alone defeated us.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When we had read how the desired smile</l>
		<l>was kissed by one who was so true a lover,</l>
		<l>this one, who never shall be parted from me,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>while all his body trembled, kissed my mouth.</l>
		<l>A Gallehault indeed, that book and he</l>
		<l>who wrote it, too; that day we read no more.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And while one spirit said these words to me,</l>
		<l>the other wept, so that-because of pity-</l>
		<l>I fainted, as if I had met my death.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then I fell as a dead body falls.</l>
	</p>
