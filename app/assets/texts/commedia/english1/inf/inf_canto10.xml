	<p>
		<l>Now, by a narrow path that ran between</l>
		<l>those torments and the ramparts of the city,</l>
		<l>my master moves ahead, I following.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O highest virtue, you who lead me through</l>
		<l>these circles of transgression, at your will,</l>
		<l>do speak to me, and satisfy my longings.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Can those who lie within the sepulchers</l>
		<l>be seen? The lids-in fact-have all been lifted;</l>
		<l>no guardian is watching over them.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;They&apos;ll all be shuttered up</l>
		<l>when they return here from Jehosaphat</l>
		<l>together with the flesh they left above.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Within this region is the cemetery</l>
		<l>of Epicurus and his followers,</l>
		<l>all those who say the soul dies with the body.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And so the question you have asked of me</l>
		<l>will soon find satisfaction while we&apos;re here,</l>
		<l>as will the longing you have hid from me.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I: &quot;Good guide, the only reason I</l>
		<l>have hid my heart was that I might speak briefly,</l>
		<l>and you, long since, encouraged me in this.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O Tuscan, you who pass alive across</l>
		<l>the fiery city with such seemly words,</l>
		<l>be kind enough to stay your journey here.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Your accent makes it clear that you belong</l>
		<l>among the natives of the noble city</l>
		<l>I may have dealt with too vindictively.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This sound had burst so unexpectedly</l>
		<l>out of one sepulcher that, trembling, I</l>
		<l>then drew a little closer to my guide.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But he told me: &quot;Turn round! What are you doing?</l>
		<l>That&apos;s Farinata who has risen there-</l>
		<l>you will see all of him from the waist up.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My eyes already were intent on his;</l>
		<l>and up he rose-his forehead and his chest-</l>
		<l>as if he had tremendous scorn for Hell.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My guide-his hands encouraging and quick-</l>
		<l>thrust me between the sepulchers toward him,</l>
		<l>saying: &quot;Your words must be appropriate.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When I&apos;d drawn closer to his sepulcher,</l>
		<l>he glanced at me, and as if in disdain,</l>
		<l>he asked of me: &quot;Who were your ancestors?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Because I wanted so to be compliant,</l>
		<l>I hid no thing from him: I told him all.</l>
		<l>At this he lifted up his brows a bit,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>then said: &quot;They were ferocious enemies</l>
		<l>of mine and of my parents and my party,</l>
		<l>so that I had to scatter them twice over.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;If they were driven out,&quot; I answered him,</l>
		<l>&quot;they still returned, both times, from every quarter</l>
		<l>but yours were never quick to learn that art.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this there rose another shade alongside,</l>
		<l>uncovered to my sight down to his chin;</l>
		<l>I think that he had risen on his knees.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He looked around me, just as if he longed</l>
		<l>to see if I had come with someone else;</l>
		<l>but then, his expectation spent, he said</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>in tears: &quot;If it is your high intellect</l>
		<l>that lets you journey here, through this blind prison</l>
		<l>where is my son? Why is he not with you?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I answered: &quot;My own powers have not brought me;</l>
		<l>he who awaits me there, leads me through here</l>
		<l>perhaps to one your Guido did disdain.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His words, the nature of his punishment-</l>
		<l>these had already let me read his name;</l>
		<l>therefore, my answer was so fully made.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then suddenly erect, he cried: &quot;What&apos;s that:</l>
		<l>He &apos;did disdain&apos;? He is not still alive?</l>
		<l>The sweet light does not strike against his eyes?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And when he noticed how I hesitated</l>
		<l>a moment in my answer, he fell back-</l>
		<l>supine-and did not show himself again.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But that great-hearted one, the other shade</l>
		<l>at whose request I&apos;d stayed, did not change aspect</l>
		<l>or turn aside his head or lean or bend;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and taking up his words where-he&apos;d left off,</l>
		<l>&quot;If they were slow,&quot; he said, &quot;to learn that art,</l>
		<l>that is more torment to me than this bed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And yet the Lady who is ruler here</l>
		<l>will not have her face kindled fifty times</l>
		<l>before you learn how heavy is that art.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And so may you return to the sweet world,</l>
		<l>tell me: why are those citizens so cruel</l>
		<l>against my kin in all of their decrees?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>To which I said: &quot;The carnage, the great bloodshed</l>
		<l>that stained the waters of the Arbia red</l>
		<l>have led us to such prayers in our temple.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He sighed and shook his head, then said: &quot;In that,</l>
		<l>I did not act alone, but certainly</l>
		<l>I&apos;d not have joined the others without cause.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But where I was alone was there where all</l>
		<l>the rest would have annihilated Florence,</l>
		<l>had I not interceded forcefully.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Ah, as I hope your seed may yet find peace,&quot;</l>
		<l>I asked, &quot;so may you help me to undo</l>
		<l>the knot that here has snarled my course of though</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It seems, if I hear right, that you can see</l>
		<l>beforehand that which time is carrying,</l>
		<l>but you&apos;re denied the sight of present things.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;We see, even as men who are farsighted,</l>
		<l>those things,&quot; he said, &quot;that are remote from us;</l>
		<l>the Highest Lord allots us that much light.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But when events draw near or are, our minds</l>
		<l>are useless; were we not informed by others,</l>
		<l>we should know nothing of your human state.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So you can understand how our awareness</l>
		<l>will die completely at the moment when</l>
		<l>the portal of the future has been shut.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then, as if penitent for my omission,</l>
		<l>I said: &quot;Will you now tell that fallen man</l>
		<l>his son is still among the living ones;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and if, a while ago, I held my tongue</l>
		<l>before his question, let him know it was</l>
		<l>because I had in mind the doubt you&apos;ve answered.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And now my master was recalling me;</l>
		<l>so that, more hurriedly, I asked the spirit</l>
		<l>to name the others who were there with him.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He said: &quot;More than a thousand lie with me:</l>
		<l>the second Frederick is but one among them,</l>
		<l>as is the Cardinal; I name no others.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>With that, he hid himself; and pondering</l>
		<l>the speech that seemed to me so menacing,</l>
		<l>I turned my steps to meet the ancient poet.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He moved ahead, and as we made our way,</l>
		<l>he said to me: &quot;Why are you so dismayed?&quot;</l>
		<l>I satisfied him, answering him fully.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then that sage exhorted me: &quot;Remember</l>
		<l>the words that have been spoken here against you.</l>
		<l>Now pay attention,&quot; and he raised his finger;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;when you shall stand before the gentle splendor</l>
		<l>of one whose gracious eyes see everything,</l>
		<l>then you shall learn-from her-your lifetime&apos;s jour</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Following that, his steps turned to the left,</l>
		<l>leaving the wall and moving toward the middle</l>
		<l>along a path that strikes into a valley</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>whose stench, as it rose up, disgusted us.</l>
	</p>
