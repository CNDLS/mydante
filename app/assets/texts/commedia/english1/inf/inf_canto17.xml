	<p>
		<l>&quot;Behold the beast who bears the pointed tail,</l>
		<l>who crosses mountains, shatters weapons, walls!</l>
		<l>Behold the one whose stench fills all the world!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So did my guide begin to speak to me,</l>
		<l>and then he signaled him to come ashore</l>
		<l>close to the end of those stone passageways.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he came on, that filthy effigy</l>
		<l>of fraud, and landed with his head and torso</l>
		<l>but did not draw his tail onto the bank.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The face he wore was that of a just man,</l>
		<l>so gracious was his features&apos; outer semblance;</l>
		<l>and all his trunk, the body of a serpent;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he had two paws, with hair up to the armpits;</l>
		<l>his back and chest as well as both his flanks</l>
		<l>had been adorned with twining knots and circlets.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No Turks or Tartars ever fashioned fabrics</l>
		<l>more colorful in background and relief,</l>
		<l>nor had Arachne ever loomed such webs.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As boats will sometimes lie along the shore,</l>
		<l>with part of them on land and part in water,</l>
		<l>and just as there, among the guzzling Germans,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the beaver sets himself when he means war,</l>
		<l>so did that squalid beast lie on the margin</l>
		<l>of stone that serves as border for the sand.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And all his tail was quivering in the void</l>
		<l>while twisting upward its envenomed fork,</l>
		<l>which had a tip just like a scorpion&apos;s.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My guide said: &quot;Now we&apos;d better bend our path</l>
		<l>a little, till we reach as far as that</l>
		<l>malicious beast which crouches over there.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus we descended on the right hand side</l>
		<l>and moved ten paces on the stony brink</l>
		<l>in order to avoid the sand and fire.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When we had reached the sprawling beast, I saw-</l>
		<l>a little farther on, upon the sand-</l>
		<l>some sinners sitting near the fissured rock.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And here my master said to me: &quot;So that</l>
		<l>you may experience this ring in full,</l>
		<l>go now, and see the state in which they are.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But keep your conversation with them brief;</l>
		<l>till you return, I&apos;ll parley with this beast,</l>
		<l>to see if he can lend us his strong shoulders.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So I went on alone and even farther</l>
		<l>along the seventh circle&apos;s outer margin,</l>
		<l>to where the melancholy people sat.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Despondency was bursting from their eyes;</l>
		<l>this side, then that, their hands kept fending off</l>
		<l>at times the flames, at times the burning soil:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>not otherwise do dogs in summer-now</l>
		<l>with muzzle, now with paw-when they are bitten</l>
		<l>by fleas or gnats or by the sharp gadfly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When I had set my eyes upon the faces</l>
		<l>of some on whom that painful fire falls,</l>
		<l>I recognized no one; but I did notice</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that from the neck of each a purse was hung</l>
		<l>that had a special color and an emblem,</l>
		<l>and their eyes seemed to feast upon these pouches.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Looking about-when I had come among them-</l>
		<l>I saw a yellow purse with azure on it</l>
		<l>that had the face and manner of a lion.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then, as I let my eyes move farther on,</l>
		<l>I saw another purse that was bloodred,</l>
		<l>and it displayed a goose more white than butter.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And one who had an azure, pregnant sow</l>
		<l>inscribed as emblem on his white pouch, said</l>
		<l>to me: &quot;What are you doing in this pit?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now you be off; and since you&apos;re still alive,</l>
		<l>remember that my neighbor Vitaliano</l>
		<l>shall yet sit here, upon my left hand side.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Among these Florentines, I&apos;m Paduan;</l>
		<l>I often hear them thunder in my ears,</l>
		<l>shouting, &apos;Now let the sovereign cavalier,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the one who&apos;ll bring the purse with three goats, come!&apos;</l>
		<l>At this he slewed his mouth, and then he stuck</l>
		<l>his tongue out, like an ox that licks its nose.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I, afraid that any longer stay</l>
		<l>might anger him who&apos;d warned me to be brief,</l>
		<l>made my way back from those exhausted souls.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I found my guide, who had already climbed</l>
		<l>upon the back of that brute animal,</l>
		<l>and he told me: &quot;Be strong and daring now,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for our descent is by this kind of stairs:</l>
		<l>you mount in front; I want to be between,</l>
		<l>so that the tail can&apos;t do you any harm.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As one who feels the quartan fever near</l>
		<l>and shivers, with his nails already blue,</l>
		<l>the sight of shade enough to make him shudder,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so I became when I had heard these words;</l>
		<l>but then I felt the threat of shame, which makes</l>
		<l>a servant-in his kind lord&apos;s presence-brave.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I settled down on those enormous shoulders;</l>
		<l>I wished to say (and yet my voice did not</l>
		<l>come as I thought): &quot;See that you hold me tight.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But he who-other times, in other dangers-</l>
		<l>sustained me, just as soon as I had mounted,</l>
		<l>clasped me within his arms and propped me up,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and said: &quot;Now, Geryon, move on; take care</l>
		<l>to keep your circles wide, your landing slow;</l>
		<l>remember the new weight you&apos;re carrying.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just like a boat that, starting from its moorings,</l>
		<l>moves backward, backward, so that beast took off;</l>
		<l>and when he felt himself completely clear,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he turned his tail to where his chest had been</l>
		<l>and, having stretched it, moved it like an eel,</l>
		<l>and with his paws he gathered in the air.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I do not think that there was greater fear</l>
		<l>in Phaethon when he let his reins go free-</l>
		<l>for which the sky, as one still sees, was scorched</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>nor in poor Icarus when he could feel ,</l>
		<l>his sides unwinged because the wax was melting,</l>
		<l>his father shouting to him, &quot;That way&apos;s wrong!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>than was in me when, on all sides, I saw</l>
		<l>that I was in the air, and everything</l>
		<l>had faded from my sight-except the beast.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Slowly, slowly, swimming, he moves on;</l>
		<l>he wheels and he descends, but I feel only</l>
		<l>the wind upon my face and the wind rising.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Already, on our right, I heard the torrent</l>
		<l>resounding, there beneath us, horribly,</l>
		<l>so that I stretched my neck and looked below.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I was more afraid of falling off,</l>
		<l>for I saw fires and I heard laments,</l>
		<l>at which I tremble, crouching, and hold fast.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And now I saw what I had missed before:</l>
		<l>his wheeling and descent-because great torments</l>
		<l>were drawing closer to us on all sides.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as a falcon long upon the wing-</l>
		<l>who, seeing neither lure nor bird, compels</l>
		<l>the falconer to cry, &quot;Ah me, you fall!&quot;-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>descends, exhausted, in a hundred circles,</l>
		<l>where he had once been swift, and sets himself,</l>
		<l>embittered and enraged, far from his master;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>such, at the bottom of the jagged rock,</l>
		<l>was Geryon, when he had set us down.</l>
		<l>And once our weight was lifted from his back,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he vanished like an arrow from a bow.</l>
	</p>
