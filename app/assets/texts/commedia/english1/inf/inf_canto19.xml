		<l>O Simon Magus! O his sad disciples!</l>
		<l>Rapacious ones, who take the things of God,</l>
		<l>that ought to be the brides of Righteousness,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and make them fornicate for gold and silver!</l>
		<l>The time has come to let the trumpet sound</l>
		<l>for you; your place is here in this third pouch.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We had already reached the tomb beyond</l>
		<l>and climbed onto the ridge, where its high point</l>
		<l>hangs just above the middle of the ditch.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O Highest Wisdom, how much art you show</l>
		<l>in heaven, earth, and this sad world below,</l>
		<l>how just your power is when it allots!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Along the sides and down along the bottom,</l>
		<l>I saw that livid rock was perforated:</l>
		<l>the openings were all one width and round.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>They did not seem to me less broad or more</l>
		<l>than those that in my handsome San Giovanni</l>
		<l>were made to serve as basins for baptizing;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and one of these, not many years ago,</l>
		<l>I broke for someone who was drowning in it:</l>
		<l>and let this be my seal to set men straight.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Out from the mouth of each hole there emerged</l>
		<l>a sinner&apos;s feet and so much of his legs</l>
		<l>up to the thigh; the rest remained within.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Both soles of every sinner were on fire;</l>
		<l>their joints were writhing with such violence,</l>
		<l>they would have severed withes and ropes of grass.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As flame on oily things will only stir</l>
		<l>along the outer surface, so there, too,</l>
		<l>that fire made its way from heels to toes.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Master,&quot; I said, &quot;who is that shade who suffers</l>
		<l>and quivers more than all his other comrades,</l>
		<l>that sinner who is licked by redder flames?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;If you would have me lead</l>
		<l>you down along the steepest of the banks,</l>
		<l>from him you&apos;ll learn about his self and sins.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I: &quot;What pleases you will please me too:</l>
		<l>you are my lord; you know I do not swerve</l>
		<l>from what you will, you know what is unspoken.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this we came upon the fourth embankment;</l>
		<l>we turned and, keeping to the left, descended</l>
		<l>into the narrow, perforated bottom.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My good lord did not let me leave his side</l>
		<l>until he&apos;d brought me to the hole that held</l>
		<l>that sinner who lamented with his legs.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Whoever you may be, dejected soul,</l>
		<l>whose head is downward, planted like a pole,&quot;</l>
		<l>my words began, &quot;do speak if you are able.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I stood as does the friar who confesses</l>
		<l>the foul assassin who, fixed fast, head down,</l>
		<l>calls back the friar, and so delays his death;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and he cried out: &quot;Are you already standing,</l>
		<l>already standing there, o Boniface?</l>
		<l>The book has lied to me by several years.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Are you so quickly sated with the riches</l>
		<l>for which you did not fear to take by guile</l>
		<l>the Lovely Lady, then to violate her?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I became like those who stand as if</l>
		<l>they have been mocked, who cannot understand</l>
		<l>what has been said to them and can&apos;t respond.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But Virgil said: &quot;Tell this to him at once:</l>
		<l>&apos;I am not he-not whom you think I am.&apos;&quot;</l>
		<l>And I replied as I was told to do.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this the spirit twisted both his feet,</l>
		<l>and sighing and with a despairing voice,</l>
		<l>he said: &quot;What is it, then, you want of me?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If you have crossed the bank and climbed so far</l>
		<l>to find out who I am, then know that I</l>
		<l>was one of those who wore the mighty mantle,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and surely was a son of the she-bear,</l>
		<l>so eager to advance the cubs that I</l>
		<l>pursed wealth above while here I purse myself.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Below my head there is the place of those</l>
		<l>who took the way of simony before me;</l>
		<l>and they are stuffed within the clefts of stone.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I, too, shall yield my place and fall below</l>
		<l>when he arrives, the one for whom I had</l>
		<l>mistaken you when I was quick to question.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But I have baked my feet a longer time,</l>
		<l>have stood like this, upon my head, than he</l>
		<l>is to stand planted here with scarlet feet:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for after him, one uglier in deeds</l>
		<l>will come, a lawless shepherd from the west,</l>
		<l>worthy to cover him and cover me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He&apos;ll be a second Jason, of whom we read</l>
		<l>in Maccabees; and just as Jason&apos;s king</l>
		<l>was soft to him, so shall the king of France</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>be soft to this one.&quot; And I do not know</l>
		<l>if I was too rash here-I answered so:</l>
		<l>&quot;Then tell me now, how much gold did our Lord</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>ask that Saint Peter give to him before</l>
		<l>he placed the keys within his care? Surely</l>
		<l>the only thing he said was: &apos;Follow me.&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And Peter and the others never asked</l>
		<l>for gold or silver when they chose Matthias</l>
		<l>to take the place of the transgressing soul.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Stay as you are, for you are rightly punished;</l>
		<l>and guard with care the money got by evil</l>
		<l>that made you so audacious against Charles.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And were it not that I am still prevented</l>
		<l>by reverence for those exalted keys</l>
		<l>that you had held within the happy life,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I&apos;d utter words much heavier than these,</l>
		<l>because your avarice afflicts the world:</l>
		<l>it tramples on the good, lifts up the wicked.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You, shepherds, the Evangelist had noticed</l>
		<l>when he saw her who sits upon the waters</l>
		<l>and realized she fornicates with kings,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>she who was born with seven heads and had</l>
		<l>the power and support of the ten horns,</l>
		<l>as long as virtue was her husband&apos;s pleasure.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You&apos;ve made yourselves a god of gold and silver;</l>
		<l>how are you different from idolaters,</l>
		<l>save that they worship one and you a hundred?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Ah, Constantine, what wickedness was born-</l>
		<l>and not from your conversion-from the dower</l>
		<l>that you bestowed upon the first rich father!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And while I sang such notes to him-whether</l>
		<l>it was his indignation or his conscience</l>
		<l>that bit him-he kicked hard with both his soles.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I do indeed believe it pleased my guide:</l>
		<l>he listened always with such satisfied</l>
		<l>expression to the sound of those true words.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then he gathered me in both his arms</l>
		<l>and, when he had me fast against his chest,</l>
		<l>where he climbed down before, climbed upward now;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>nor did he tire of clasping me until</l>
		<l>he brought me to the summit of the arch</l>
		<l>that crosses from the fourth to the fifth rampart.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And here he gently set his burden down-</l>
		<l>gently because the ridge was rough and steep,</l>
		<l>and would have been a rugged pass for goats.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>From there another valley lay before me.</l>
	</p>
