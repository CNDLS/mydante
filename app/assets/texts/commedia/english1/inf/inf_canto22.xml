		<l>Before this I&apos;ve seen horsemen start to march</l>
		<l>and open the assault and muster ranks</l>
		<l>and seen them, too, at times beat their retreat;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and on your land, o Aretines, I&apos;ve seen</l>
		<l>rangers and raiding parties galloping,</l>
		<l>the clash of tournaments, the rush of jousts,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>now done with trumpets, now with bells, and now</l>
		<l>with drums, and now with signs from castle walls,</l>
		<l>with native things and with imported ware;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but never yet have I seen horsemen or</l>
		<l>seen infantry or ship that sails by signal</l>
		<l>of land or star move to so strange a bugle!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We made our way together with ten demons:</l>
		<l>ah, what ferocious company! And yet</l>
		<l>&quot;in church with saints, with rotters in the tavern.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But I was all intent upon the pitch,</l>
		<l>to seek out every feature of the pouch</l>
		<l>and of the people who were burning in it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as the dolphins do, when with arched back,</l>
		<l>they signal to the seamen to prepare</l>
		<l>for tempest, that their vessel may be spared,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so here from time to time, to ease his torment,</l>
		<l>some sinner showed his back above the surface,</l>
		<l>then hid more quickly than a lightning flash.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And just as on the margin of a ditch,</l>
		<l>frogs crouch, their snouts alone above the water,</l>
		<l>so as to hide their feet and their plump flesh,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so here on every side these sinners crouched;</l>
		<l>but faster than a flash, when Barbariccia</l>
		<l>drew near, they plunged beneath the boiling pitch.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw-my heart still shudders in recall-</l>
		<l>one who delayed, just as at times a frog</l>
		<l>is left behind while others dive below;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and Graffiacane, who was closest to him,</l>
		<l>then hooked him by his pitch-entangled locks</l>
		<l>and hauled him up; he seemed to me an otter.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>By now I knew the names of all those demons-</l>
		<l>I&apos;d paid attention when the fiends were chosen;</l>
		<l>I&apos;d watched as they stepped forward one by one.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O Rubicante, see you set your talons</l>
		<l>right into him, so you can flay his flesh!&quot;</l>
		<l>So did those cursed ones cry out together.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I: &quot;My master, if you can, find out</l>
		<l>what is the name of that unfortunate</l>
		<l>who&apos;s fallen victim to his enemies.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My guide, who then drew near that sinner&apos;s side,</l>
		<l>asked him to tell his birthplace. He replied:</l>
		<l>&quot;My homeland was the kingdom of Navarre.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My mother, who had had me by a wastrel,</l>
		<l>destroyer of himself and his possessions,</l>
		<l>had placed me in the service of a lord.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I was in the household of the worthy</l>
		<l>King Thibault; there I started taking graft;</l>
		<l>with this heat I pay reckoning for that.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And Ciriatto, from whose mouth there bulged</l>
		<l>to right and left two tusks like a wild hog&apos;s,</l>
		<l>then let him feel how one of them could mangle.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The mouse had fallen in with evil cats;</l>
		<l>but Barbariccia clasped him in his arms</l>
		<l>and said: &quot;Stand off there, while I fork him fast.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And turning toward my master then, he said:</l>
		<l>&quot;Ask on, if you would learn some more from him</l>
		<l>before one of the others does him in.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At which my guide: &quot;Now tell: among the sinners</l>
		<l>who hide beneath the pitch, are any others</l>
		<l>Italian?&quot; And he: &quot;I have just left</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>one who was nearby there; and would I were</l>
		<l>still covered by the pitch as he is hidden,</l>
		<l>for then I&apos;d have no fear of hook or talon.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And Libicocco said, &quot;We&apos;ve been too patient!&quot;</l>
		<l>and, with his grapple, grabbed him by the arm</l>
		<l>and, ripping, carried off a hunk of flesh.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But Draghignazzo also looked as if</l>
		<l>to grab his legs; at which, their captain wheeled</l>
		<l>and threatened all of them with raging looks.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When they&apos;d grown somewhat less tumultuous,</l>
		<l>without delay my guide asked of that one</l>
		<l>who had his eyes still fixed upon his wound:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Who was the one you left to come ashore-</l>
		<l>unluckily-as you just said before?&quot;</l>
		<l>He answered: &quot;Fra Gomita of Gallura,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>who was a vessel fit for every fraud;</l>
		<l>he had his master&apos;s enemies in hand,</l>
		<l>but handled them in ways that pleased them all.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He took their gold and smoothly let them off,</l>
		<l>as he himself says; and in other matters,</l>
		<l>he was a sovereign, not a petty, swindler.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His comrade there is Don Michele Zanche</l>
		<l>of Logodoro; and their tongues are never</l>
		<l>too tired to talk of their Sardinia.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Ah me, see that one there who grinds his teeth!</l>
		<l>If I were not afraid, I&apos;d speak some more,</l>
		<l>but he is getting set to scratch my scurf.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And their great marshal, facing Farfarello-</l>
		<l>who was so hot to strike he rolled his eyes,</l>
		<l>said: &quot;Get away from there, you filthy bird!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;If you perhaps would like to see or hear,&quot;</l>
		<l>that sinner, terrified, began again,</l>
		<l>&quot;Lombards or Tuscans, I can fetch you some;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but let the Malebranche stand aside</l>
		<l>so that my comrades need not fear their vengeance.</l>
		<l>Remaining in this very spot, I shall,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>although alone, make seven more appear</l>
		<l>when I have whistled, as has been our custom</l>
		<l>when one of us has managed to get out.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At that, Cagnazzo lifted up his snout</l>
		<l>and shook his head, and said: &quot;Just listen to</l>
		<l>that trick by which he thinks he can dive back!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>To this, he who was rich in artifice</l>
		<l>replied: &quot;Then I must have too many tricks,</l>
		<l>if I bring greater torment to my friends.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This was too much for Alichino and,</l>
		<l>despite the others, he cried out: &quot;If you</l>
		<l>dive back, I shall not gallop after you</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but beat my wings above the pitch; we&apos;ll leave</l>
		<l>this height; with the embankment as a screen,</l>
		<l>we&apos;ll see if you-alone-can handle us.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O you who read, hear now of this new sport:</l>
		<l>each turned his eyes upon the other shore,</l>
		<l>he first who&apos;d been most hesitant before.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The Navarrese, in nick of time, had planted</l>
		<l>his feet upon the ground; then in an instant</l>
		<l>he jumped and freed himself from their commander.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this each demon felt the prick of guilt,</l>
		<l>and most, he who had led his band to blunder;</l>
		<l>so he took off and shouted: &quot;You are caught!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But this could help him little; wings were not</l>
		<l>more fast than fear; the sinner plunged right under;</l>
		<l>the other, flying up, lifted his chest:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>not otherwise the wild duck when it plunges</l>
		<l>precipitously, when the falcon nears</l>
		<l>and then-exhausted, thwarted-flies back up.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But Calcabrina, raging at the trick,</l>
		<l>flew after Alichino; he was keen</l>
		<l>to see the sinner free and have a brawl;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and once the Navarrese had disappeared,</l>
		<l>he turned his talons on his fellow demon</l>
		<l>and tangled with him just above the ditch.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But Alichino clawed him well-he was</l>
		<l>indeed a full-grown kestrel; and both fell</l>
		<l>into the middle of the boiling pond.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The heat was quick to disentangle them,</l>
		<l>but still there was no way they could get out;</l>
		<l>their wings were stuck, enmeshed in glue-like pitch.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And Barbariccia, grieving with the rest,</l>
		<l>sent four to fly out toward the other shore</l>
		<l>with all their forks, and speedily enough</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>on this side and on that they took their posts;</l>
		<l>and toward those two-stuck fast, already cooked</l>
		<l>beneath that crust-they stretched their grappling hooks.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We left them still contending with that mess.</l>
	</p>
