		<l>Who, even with untrammeled words and many</l>
		<l>attempts at telling, ever could recount</l>
		<l>in full the blood and wounds that I now saw?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Each tongue that tried would certainly fall short</l>
		<l>because the shallowness of both our speech</l>
		<l>and intellect cannot contain so much.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Were you to reassemble all the men</l>
		<l>who once, within Apulia&apos;s fateful land,</l>
		<l>had mourned their blood, shed at the Trojans&apos; hand</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>as well as those who fell in the long war</l>
		<l>where massive mounds of rings were battle spoils-</l>
		<l>even as Livy writes, who does not err-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and those who felt the thrust of painful blows</l>
		<l>when they fought hard against Robert Guiscard;</l>
		<l>with all the rest whose bones are still piled up</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>at Ceperano-each Apulian was</l>
		<l>a traitor there-and, too, at Tagliacozzo,</l>
		<l>where old Alardo conquered without weapons;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and then, were one to show his limb pierced through</l>
		<l>and one his limb hacked off, that would not match</l>
		<l>the hideousness of the ninth abyss.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No barrel, even though it&apos;s lost a hoop</l>
		<l>or end- piece, ever gapes as one whom I</l>
		<l>saw ripped right from his chin to where we fart:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>his bowels hung between his legs, one saw</l>
		<l>his vitals and the miserable sack</l>
		<l>that makes of what we swallow excrement.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>While I was all intent on watching him,</l>
		<l>he looked at me, and with his hands he spread</l>
		<l>his chest and said: &quot;See how I split myself!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>See now how maimed Mohammed is! And he</l>
		<l>who walks and weeps before me is Ali,</l>
		<l>whose face is opened wide from chin to forelock.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And all the others here whom you can see</l>
		<l>were, when alive, the sowers of dissension</l>
		<l>and scandal, and for this they now are split.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Behind us here, a devil decks us out</l>
		<l>so cruelly, re-placing every one</l>
		<l>of this throng underneath the sword edge when</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>we&apos;ve made our way around the road of pain,</l>
		<l>because our wounds have closed again before</l>
		<l>we have returned to meet his blade once more.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But who are you who dawdle on this ridge,</l>
		<l>perhaps to slow your going to the verdict</l>
		<l>that was pronounced on your self-accusations?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Death has not reached him yet,&quot; my master answered</l>
		<l>&quot;nor is it guilt that summons him to torment;</l>
		<l>but that he may gain full experience,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I, who am dead, must guide him here below,</l>
		<l>to circle after circle, throughout Hell:</l>
		<l>this is as true as that I speak to you.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>More than a hundred, when they heard him, stopped</l>
		<l>within the ditch and turned to look at me,</l>
		<l>forgetful of their torture, wondering.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Then you, who will perhaps soon see the sun,</l>
		<l>tell Fra Dolcino to provide himself</l>
		<l>with food, if he has no desire to join me</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>here quickly, lest when snow besieges him,</l>
		<l>it bring the Novarese the victory</l>
		<l>that otherwise they would not find too easy.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When he had raised his heel, as if to go,</l>
		<l>Mohammed said these words to me, and then</l>
		<l>he set it on the ground and off he went.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Another sinner, with his throat slit through</l>
		<l>and with his nose hacked off up to his eyebrows,</l>
		<l>and no more than a single ear remaining,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>had-with the others-stayed his steps in wonder;</l>
		<l>he was the first, before the rest, to open</l>
		<l>his windpipe-on the outside, all bloodred-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and said: &quot;O you whom guilt does not condemn,</l>
		<l>and whom, unless too close resemblance cheats me,</l>
		<l>I&apos;ve seen above upon Italian soil,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>remember Pier da Medicina if</l>
		<l>you ever see again the gentle plain</l>
		<l>that from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And let the two best men of Fano know-</l>
		<l>I mean both Messer Guido and Angiolello-</l>
		<l>that, if the foresight we have here&apos;s not vain,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>they will be cast out of their ship and drowned,</l>
		<l>weighed down with stones, near La Cattolica,</l>
		<l>because of a foul tyrant&apos;s treachery.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca,</l>
		<l>Neptune has never seen so cruel a crime</l>
		<l>committed by the pirates or the Argives.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That traitor who sees only with one eye</l>
		<l>and rules the land which one who&apos;s here with me</l>
		<l>would wish his sight had never seen, will call</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Guido and Angiolello to a parley,</l>
		<l>and then will so arrange it that they&apos;ll need</l>
		<l>no vow or prayer to Focara&apos;s wind!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I to him: &quot;If you would have me carry</l>
		<l>some news of you above, then tell and show me</l>
		<l>who so detests the sight of Rimini.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then he set his hand upon the jaw</l>
		<l>of a companion, opening his mouth</l>
		<l>and shouting: &quot;This is he, and he speaks not.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>A man cast out, he quenched the doubt in Caesar,</l>
		<l>insisting that the one who is prepared</l>
		<l>can only suffer harm if he delays.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Oh, how dismayed and pained he seemed to me,</l>
		<l>his tongue slit in his gullet: Curio,</l>
		<l>who once was so audacious in his talk!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And one who walked with both his hands hacked off,</l>
		<l>while lifting up his stumps through the dark air,</l>
		<l>so that his face was hideous with blood,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>cried out: &quot;You will remember Mosca, too,</l>
		<l>who said-alas-&apos;What&apos;s done is at an end,&apos;</l>
		<l>which was the seed of evil for the Tuscans.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I added: &quot;-and brought death to your own kinsmen&quot;;</l>
		<l>then having heard me speak, grief heaped on grief,</l>
		<l>he went his way as one gone mad with sadness.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But I stayed there to watch that company</l>
		<l>and saw a thing that I should be afraid</l>
		<l>to tell with no more proof than my own self-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>except that I am reassured by conscience,</l>
		<l>that good companion, heartening a man</l>
		<l>beneath the breastplate of its purity.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I surely saw, and it still seems I see,</l>
		<l>a trunk without a head that walked just like</l>
		<l>the others in that melancholy herd;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>it carried by the hair its severed head,</l>
		<l>which swayed within its hand just like a lantern;</l>
		<l>and that head looked at us and said: &quot;Ah me!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Out of itself it made itself a lamp,</l>
		<l>and they were two in one and one in two;</l>
		<l>how that can be, He knows who so decrees.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When it was just below the bridge, it lifted</l>
		<l>its arm together with its head, so that</l>
		<l>its words might be more near us, words that said:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Now you can see atrocious punishment,</l>
		<l>you who, still breathing, go to view the dead:</l>
		<l>see if there&apos;s any pain as great as this.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And so that you may carry news of me,</l>
		<l>know that I am Bertran de Born, the one</l>
		<l>who gave bad counsel to the fledgling king.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I made the son and father enemies:</l>
		<l>Achitophel with his malicious urgings</l>
		<l>did not do worse with Absalom and David.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Because I severed those so joined, I carry-</l>
		<l>alas-my brain dissevered from its source,</l>
		<l>which is within my trunk. And thus, in me</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>one sees the law of counter-penalty.&quot;</l>
