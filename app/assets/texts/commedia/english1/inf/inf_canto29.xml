	<p>
		<l>So many souls and such outlandish wounds</l>
		<l>had made my eyes inebriate-they longed</l>
		<l>to stay and weep. But Virgil said to me:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Why are you staring so insistently?</l>
		<l>Why does your vision linger there below</l>
		<l>among the lost and mutilated shadows?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You did not do so at the other moats.</l>
		<l>If you would count them all, consider: twenty-</l>
		<l>two miles make up the circuit of the valley.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The moon already is beneath our feet;</l>
		<l>the time alloted to us now is short,</l>
		<l>and there is more to see than you see here.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Had you,&quot; I answered him without a pause,</l>
		<l>&quot;been able to consider why I looked,</l>
		<l>you might have granted me a longer stay.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Meanwhile my guide had moved ahead; I went</l>
		<l>behind him, answering as I walked on,</l>
		<l>and adding: &quot;In that hollow upon which</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>just now, I kept my eyes intent, I think</l>
		<l>a spirit born of my own blood laments</l>
		<l>the guilt which, down below, costs one so much.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this my master said: &quot;Don&apos;t let your thoughts</l>
		<l>about him interrupt you from here on:</l>
		<l>attend to other things, let him stay there;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for I saw him below the little bridge,</l>
		<l>his finger pointing at you, threatening,</l>
		<l>and heard him called by name -Geri del Bello.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But at that moment you were occupied</l>
		<l>with him who once was lord of Hautefort;</l>
		<l>you did not notice Geri-he moved off.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;My guide, it was his death by violence,</l>
		<l>for which he still is not avenged,&quot; I said,</l>
		<l>&quot;by anyone who shares his shame, that made</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>him so disdainful now; and-I suppose-</l>
		<l>for this he left without a word to me,</l>
		<l>and this has made me pity him the more.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And so we talked until we found the first</l>
		<l>point of the ridge that, if there were more light,</l>
		<l>would show the other valley to the bottom.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When we had climbed above the final cloister</l>
		<l>of Malebolge, so that its lay brothers</l>
		<l>were able to appear before our eyes,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I felt the force of strange laments, like arrows</l>
		<l>whose shafts are barbed with pity; and at this,</l>
		<l>I had to place my hands across my ears.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just like the sufferings that all the sick</l>
		<l>of Val di Chiana&apos;s hospitals, Maremma&apos;s,</l>
		<l>Sardina&apos;s, from July until September</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>would muster if assembled in one ditch-</l>
		<l>so was it here, and such a stench rose up</l>
		<l>as usually comes from festering limbs.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And keeping always to the left, we climbed</l>
		<l>down to the final bank of the long ridge,</l>
		<l>and then my sight could see more vividly</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>into the bottom, where unerring Justice,</l>
		<l>the minister of the High Lord, punishes</l>
		<l>the falsifiers she had registered.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I do not think that there was greater grief</l>
		<l>in seeing all Aegina&apos;s people sick</l>
		<l>(then, when the air was so infected that</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>all animals, down to the little worm,</l>
		<l>collapsed; and afterward, as poets hold</l>
		<l>to be the certain truth, those ancient peoples</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>received their health again through seed of ants)</l>
		<l>than I felt when I saw, in that dark valley,</l>
		<l>the spirits languishing in scattered heaps.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Some lay upon their bellies, some upon</l>
		<l>the shoulders of another spirit, some</l>
		<l>crawled on all fours along that squalid road.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We journeyed step by step without a word,</l>
		<l>watching and listening to those sick souls,</l>
		<l>who had not strength enough to lift themselves.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw two sitting propped against each other-</l>
		<l>as pan is propped on pan to heat them up-</l>
		<l>and each, from head to foot, spotted with scabs;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and I have never seen a stableboy</l>
		<l>whose master waits for him, or one who stays</l>
		<l>awake reluctantly, so ply a horse</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>with currycomb, as they assailed themselves</l>
		<l>with clawing nails-their itching had such force</l>
		<l>and fury, and there was no other help.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And so their nails kept scraping off the scabs,</l>
		<l>just as a knife scrapes off the scales of carp</l>
		<l>or of another fish with scales more large.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O you who use your nails to strip yourself,&quot;</l>
		<l>my guide began to say to one of them,</l>
		<l>&quot;and sometimes have to turn them into pincers,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>tell us if there are some Italians</l>
		<l>among the sinners in this moat-so may</l>
		<l>your nails hold out, eternal, at their work.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;We two whom you see so disfigured here,</l>
		<l>we are Italians,&quot; one said, in tears.</l>
		<l>&quot;But who are you who have inquired of us?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My guide replied: &quot;From circle down to circle,</l>
		<l>together with this living man, I am</l>
		<l>one who descends; I mean to show him Hell.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this their mutual support broke off;</l>
		<l>and, quivering, each spirit turned toward me</l>
		<l>with others who, by chance, had heard his words.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then my good master drew more close to me,</l>
		<l>saying: &quot;Now tell them what it is you want.&quot;</l>
		<l>And I began to speak, just as he wished:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;So that your memory may never fade</l>
		<l>within the first world from the minds of men,</l>
		<l>but still live on-and under many suns-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>do tell me who you are and from what city,</l>
		<l>and do not let your vile and filthy torment</l>
		<l>make you afraid to let me know your names.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>One answered me:&quot;My city was Arezzo</l>
		<l>and Albero of Siena had me burned;</l>
		<l>but what I died for does not bring me here.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It&apos;s true that I had told him-jestingly-</l>
		<l>&apos;I&apos;d know enough to fly through air&apos;; and he,</l>
		<l>with curiosity, but little sense,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>wished me to show that art to him and, just</l>
		<l>because I had not made him Daedalus,</l>
		<l>had one who held him as a son burn me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But Minos, who cannot mistake, condemned</l>
		<l>my spirit to the final pouch of ten</l>
		<l>for alchemy I practiced in the world.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then I asked the poet: &quot;Was there ever</l>
		<l>so vain a people as the Sienese?</l>
		<l>Even the French can&apos;t match such vanity.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this, the other leper, who had heard me,</l>
		<l>replied to what I&apos;d said: &quot;Except for Stricca,</l>
		<l>for he knew how to spend most frugally;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and Niccolo, the first to make men see</l>
		<l>that cloves can serve as luxury (such seed,</l>
		<l>in gardens where it suits, can take fast root);</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and, too, Caccia d&apos;Asciano&apos;s company,</l>
		<l>with whom he squandered vineyards and tilled field</l>
		<l>while Abbagliato showed such subtlety.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But if you want to know who joins you so</l>
		<l>against the Sienese, look hard at me-</l>
		<l>that way, my face can also answer rightly-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and see that I&apos;m the shade of that Capocchio</l>
		<l>whose alchemy could counterfeit fine metals.</l>
		<l>And you, if I correctly take your measure,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>recall how apt I was at aping nature.&quot;</l>
