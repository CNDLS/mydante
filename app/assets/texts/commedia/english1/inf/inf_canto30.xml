		<l>When Juno was incensed with Semele</l>
		<l>and, thus, against the Theban family</l>
		<l>had shown her fury time and time again,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>then Athamas was driven so insane</l>
		<l>that, seeing both his wife and their two sons,</l>
		<l>as she bore one upon each arm, he cried:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Let&apos;s spread the nets, to take the lioness</l>
		<l>together with her cubs along the pass&quot;;</l>
		<l>and he stretched out his talons, pitiless,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and snatched the son who bore the name Learchus,</l>
		<l>whirled him around and dashed him on a rock;</l>
		<l>she, with her other burden, drowned herself.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And after fortune turned against the pride</l>
		<l>of Troy, which had dared all, so that the king</l>
		<l>together with his kingdom, was destroyed,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>then Hecuba was wretched, sad, a captive;</l>
		<l>and after she had seen Polyxena</l>
		<l>dead and, in misery, had recognized</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>her Polydorus lying on the shore,</l>
		<l>she barked, out of her senses, like a dog-</l>
		<l>her agony had so deformed her mind.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But neither fury-Theban, Trojan-ever</l>
		<l>was seen to be so cruel against another,</l>
		<l>in rending beasts and even human limbs,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>as were two shades I saw, both pale and naked,</l>
		<l>who, biting, ran berserk in just the way</l>
		<l>a hog does when it&apos;s let loose from its sty.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The one came at Capocchio and sank</l>
		<l>his tusks into his neck so that, by dragging,</l>
		<l>he made the hard ground scrape against his belly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he who stayed behind, the Aretine,</l>
		<l>trembled and said: &quot;That phantom&apos;s Gianni Schicchi</l>
		<l>and he goes raging, rending others so.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And, &quot;Oh,&quot; I said to him, &quot;so may the other</l>
		<l>not sink its teeth in you, please tell me who</l>
		<l>it is before it hurries off from here.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;That is the ancient soul</l>
		<l>of the indecent Myrrha, she who loved</l>
		<l>her father past the limits of just love.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>She came to sin with him by falsely taking</l>
		<l>another&apos;s shape upon herself, just as</l>
		<l>the other phantom who goes there had done,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that he might gain the lady of the herd,</l>
		<l>when he disguised himself as Buoso Donati,</l>
		<l>making a will as if most properly.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And when the pair of raging ones had passed,</l>
		<l>those two on whom my eyes were fixed, I turned</l>
		<l>around to see the rest of the ill-born.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw one who&apos;d be fashioned like a lute</l>
		<l>if he had only had his groin cut off</l>
		<l>from that part of his body where it forks.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The heavy dropsy, which so disproportions</l>
		<l>the limbs with unassimilated humors</l>
		<l>that there&apos;s no match between the face and belly,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>had made him part his lips like a consumptive,</l>
		<l>who will, because of thirst, let one lip drop</l>
		<l>down to his chin and lift the other up.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O you exempt from every punishment</l>
		<l>in this grim world, and I do not know why,&quot;</l>
		<l>he said to us, &quot;look now and pay attention</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to this, the misery of Master Adam:</l>
		<l>alive, I had enough of all I wanted;</l>
		<l>alas, I now long for one drop of water.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The rivulets that fall into the Arno</l>
		<l>down from the green hills of the Casentino</l>
		<l>with channels cool and moist, are constantly</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>before me; I am racked by memory-</l>
		<l>the image of their flow parches me more</l>
		<l>than the disease that robs my face of flesh.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The rigid Justice that would torment me</l>
		<l>uses, as most appropriate, the place</l>
		<l>where I had sinned, to draw swift sighs from me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There is Romena, there I counterfeited</l>
		<l>the currency that bears the Baptist&apos;s seal;</l>
		<l>for this I left my body, burned, above.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But could I see the miserable souls</l>
		<l>of Guido, Alessandro, or their brother,</l>
		<l>I&apos;d not give up the sight for Fonte Branda.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And one of them is in this moat already,</l>
		<l>if what the angry shades report is true.</l>
		<l>What use is that to me whose limbs are tied?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Were I so light that, in a hundred years,</l>
		<l>I could advance an inch, I should already</l>
		<l>be well upon the road to search for him</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>among the mutilated ones, although</l>
		<l>this circuit measures some eleven miles</l>
		<l>and is at least a half a mile across.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Because of them I&apos;m in this family;</l>
		<l>it was those three who had incited me</l>
		<l>to coin the florins with three carats&apos; dross.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I to him: &quot;Who are those two poor sinners</l>
		<l>who give off smoke like wet hands in the winter</l>
		<l>and lie so close to you upon the right?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;I found them here,&quot; he answered, &quot;when I rained</l>
		<l>down to this rocky slope; they&apos;ve not stirred since</l>
		<l>and will not move, I think, eternally.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>One is the lying woman who blamed Joseph;</l>
		<l>the other, lying Sinon, Greek from Troy:</l>
		<l>because of raging fever they reek so.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And one of them, who seemed to take offense,</l>
		<l>perhaps at being named so squalidly,</l>
		<l>struck with his fist at Adam&apos;s rigid belly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It sounded as if it had been a drum;</l>
		<l>and Master Adam struck him in the face,</l>
		<l>using his arm, which did not seem less hard,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>saying to him: &quot;Although I cannot move</l>
		<l>my limbs because they are too heavy, I</l>
		<l>still have an arm that&apos;s free to serve that need.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he replied: &quot;But when you went to burning,</l>
		<l>your arm was not as quick as it was now;</l>
		<l>though when you coined, it was as quick and more.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>To which the dropsied one: &quot;Here you speak true;</l>
		<l>but you were not so true a witness there,</l>
		<l>when you were asked to tell the truth at Troy.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;If I spoke false, you falsified the coin,&quot;</l>
		<l>said Sinon; &quot;I am here for just one crime-</l>
		<l>but you&apos;ve committed more than any demon.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Do not forget the horse, you perjurer,&quot;</l>
		<l>replied the one who had the bloated belly,</l>
		<l>&quot;may you be plagued because the whole world knows</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The Greek: &quot;And you be plagued by thirst that cracks</l>
		<l>your tongue, and putrid water that has made</l>
		<l>your belly such a hedge before your eyes.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then the coiner: &quot;So, as usual,</l>
		<l>your mouth, because of racking fever, gapes;</l>
		<l>for if I thirst and if my humor bloats me,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>you have both dryness and a head that aches;</l>
		<l>few words would be sufficient invitation</l>
		<l>to have you lick the mirror of Narcissus.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I was intent on listening to them</l>
		<l>when this was what my master said: &quot;If you</l>
		<l>insist on looking more, I&apos;ll quarrel with you!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And when I heard him speak so angrily,</l>
		<l>I turned around to him with shame so great</l>
		<l>that it still stirs within my memory.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even as one who dreams that he is harmed</l>
		<l>and, dreaming, wishes he were dreaming, thus</l>
		<l>desiring that which is, as if it were not,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so I became within my speechlessness:</l>
		<l>I wanted to excuse myself and did</l>
		<l>excuse myself, although I knew it not.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Less shame would wash away a greater fault</l>
		<l>than was your fault,&quot; my master said to me;</l>
		<l>&quot;therefore release yourself from all remorse</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and see that I am always at your side,</l>
		<l>should it so happen-once again-that fortune</l>
		<l>brings you where men would quarrel in this fashion</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to want to hear such bickering is base.&quot;</l>
