	<p>
		<l>Had I the crude and scrannel rhymes to suit</l>
		<l>the melancholy hole upon which all</l>
		<l>the other circling crags converge and rest,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the juice of my conception would be pressed</l>
		<l>more fully; but because I feel their lack,</l>
		<l>I bring myself to speak, yet speak in fear;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for it is not a task to take in jest,</l>
		<l>to show the base of all the universe-</l>
		<l>nor for a tongue that cries out, &quot;mama,&quot; &quot;papa.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But may those ladies now sustain my verse</l>
		<l>who helped Amphion when he walled up Thebes,</l>
		<l>so that my tale not differ from the fact.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O rabble, miscreated past all others,</l>
		<l>there in the place of which it&apos;s hard to speak,</l>
		<l>better if here you had been goats or sheep!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When we were down below in the dark well,</l>
		<l>beneath the giant&apos;s feet and lower yet,</l>
		<l>with my eyes still upon the steep embankment,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I heard this said to me: &quot;Watch how you pass;</l>
		<l>walk so that you not trample with your soles</l>
		<l>the heads of your exhausted, wretched brothers.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this I turned and saw in front of me,</l>
		<l>beneath my feet, a lake that, frozen fast,</l>
		<l>had lost the look of water and seemed glass.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The Danube where it flows in Austria,</l>
		<l>the Don beneath its frozen sky, have never</l>
		<l>made for their course so thick a veil in winter</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>as there was here; for had Mount Tambernic</l>
		<l>or Pietrapana&apos;s mountain crashed upon it,</l>
		<l>not even at the edge would it have creaked.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And as the croaking frog sits with its muzzle</l>
		<l>above the water, in the season when</l>
		<l>the peasant woman often dreams of gleaning,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so, livid in the ice, up to the place</l>
		<l>where shame can show itself, were those sad shades</l>
		<l>whose teeth were chattering with notes like storks</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Each kept his face bent downward steadily;</l>
		<l>their mouths bore witness to the cold they felt,</l>
		<l>just as their eyes proclaimed their sorry hearts.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When I had looked around a while, my eyes</l>
		<l>turned toward my feet and saw two locked so close,</l>
		<l>the hair upon their heads had intermingled.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Do tell me, you whose chests are pressed so tight</l>
		<l>I said, &quot;who are you?&quot; They bent back their necks,</l>
		<l>and when they&apos;d lifted up their faces toward me,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>their eyes, which wept upon the ground before,</l>
		<l>shed tears down on their lips until the cold</l>
		<l>held fast the tears and locked their lids still more</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No clamp has ever fastened plank to plank</l>
		<l>so tightly; and because of this, they butted</l>
		<l>each other like two rams, such was their fury.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And one from whom the cold had taken both</l>
		<l>his ears, who kept his face bent low, then said:</l>
		<l>&quot;Why do you keep on staring so at us?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If you would like to know who these two are:</l>
		<l>that valley where Bisenzio descends,</l>
		<l>belonged to them and to their father Alberto.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>They came out of one body; and you can</l>
		<l>search all Caina, you will never find</l>
		<l>a shade more fit to sit within this ice-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>not him who, at one blow, had chest and shadow</l>
		<l>shattered by Arthur&apos;s hand; and not Focaccia;</l>
		<l>and not this sinner here who so impedes</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>my vision with his head, I can&apos;t see past him;</l>
		<l>his name was Sassol Mascheroni; if</l>
		<l>you&apos;re Tuscan, now you know who he has been.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And lest you keep me talking any longer,</l>
		<l>know that I was Camiscion de&apos; Pazzi;</l>
		<l>I&apos;m waiting for Carlino to absolve me.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And after that I saw a thousand faces</l>
		<l>made doglike by the cold; for which I shudder-</l>
		<l>and always will-when I face frozen fords.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And while we were advancing toward the center</l>
		<l>to which all weight is drawn-I, shivering</l>
		<l>in that eternally cold shadow-I</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>know not if it was will or destiny</l>
		<l>or chance, but as I walked among the heads,</l>
		<l>I struck my foot hard in the face of one.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Weeping, he chided then: &quot;Why trample me?</l>
		<l>If you&apos;ve not come to add to the revenge</l>
		<l>of Montaperti, why do you molest me?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I: &quot;My master, now wait here for me,</l>
		<l>that I may clear up just one doubt about him;</l>
		<l>then you can make me hurry as you will.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My guide stood fast, and I went on to ask</l>
		<l>of him who still was cursing bitterly:</l>
		<l>&quot;Who are you that rebukes another so?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;And who are you who go through Antenora,</l>
		<l>striking the cheeks of others,&quot; he replied,</l>
		<l>&quot;too roughly-even if you were alive?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;I am alive, and can be precious to you</l>
		<l>if you want fame,&quot; was my reply, &quot;for I</l>
		<l>can set your name among my other notes.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;I want the contrary;</l>
		<l>so go away and do not harass me-</l>
		<l>your flattery is useless in this valley.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At that I grabbed him by the scruff and said:</l>
		<l>&quot;You&apos;ll have to name yourself to me or else</l>
		<l>you won&apos;t have even one hair left up here.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;Though you should strip me bald,</l>
		<l>I shall not tell you who I am or show it,</l>
		<l>not if you pound my head a thousand times.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His hairs were wound around my hand already,</l>
		<l>and I had plucked from him more than one tuft</l>
		<l>while he was barking and his eyes stared down,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when someone else cried out: &quot;What is it, Bocca?</l>
		<l>Isn&apos;t the music of your jaws enough</l>
		<l>for you without your bark? What devil&apos;s at you?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;And now,&quot; I said, &quot;you traitor bent on evil,</l>
		<l>I do not need your talk, for I shall carry</l>
		<l>true news of you, and that will bring you shame.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Be off,&quot; he answered; &quot;tell them what you like,</l>
		<l>but don&apos;t be silent, if you make it back,</l>
		<l>about the one whose tongue was now so quick.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Here he laments the silver of the Frenchmen;</l>
		<l>&apos;I saw,&apos; you then can say, &apos;him of Duera,</l>
		<l>down there, where all the sinners are kept cool.&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And if you&apos;re asked who else was there in ice,</l>
		<l>one of the Beccheria is beside you-</l>
		<l>he had his gullet sliced right through by Florence</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Gianni de&apos; Soldanieri, I believe,</l>
		<l>lies there with Ganelon and Tebaldello,</l>
		<l>he who unlocked Faenza while it slept.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We had already taken leave of him,</l>
		<l>when I saw two shades frozen in one hole,</l>
		<l>so that one&apos;s head served as the other&apos;s cap;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and just as he who&apos;s hungry chews his bread,</l>
		<l>one sinner dug his teeth into the other</l>
		<l>right at the place where brain is joined to nape:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>no differently had Tydeus gnawed the temples</l>
		<l>of Menalippus, out of indignation,</l>
		<l>than this one chewed the skull and other parts.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O you who show, with such a bestial sign,</l>
		<l>your hatred for the one on whom you feed,</l>
		<l>tell me the cause,&quot; I said; &quot;we can agree</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that if your quarrel with him is justified,</l>
		<l>then knowing who you are and what&apos;s his sin,</l>
		<l>I shall repay you yet on earth above,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>if that with which I speak does not dry up.&quot;</l>
