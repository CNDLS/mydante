	<p>
		<l>The heavy sleep within my head was smashed</l>
		<l>by an enormous thunderclap, so that</l>
		<l>I started up as one whom force awakens;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I stood erect and turned my rested eyes</l>
		<l>from side to side, and I stared steadily</l>
		<l>to learn what place it was surrounding me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>In truth I found myself upon the brink</l>
		<l>of an abyss, the melancholy valley</l>
		<l>containing thundering, unending wailings.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That valley, dark and deep and filled with mist,</l>
		<l>is such that, though I gazed into its pit,</l>
		<l>I was unable to discern a thing.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Let us descend into the blind world now,&quot;</l>
		<l>the poet, who was deathly pale, began;</l>
		<l>&quot;I shall go first and you will follow me.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But I, who&apos;d seen the change in his complexion,</l>
		<l>said: &quot;How shall I go on if you are frightened,</l>
		<l>you who have always helped dispel my doubts?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;The anguish of the people</l>
		<l>whose place is here below, has touched my face</l>
		<l>with the compassion you mistake for fear.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Let us go on, the way that waits is long.&quot;</l>
		<l>So he set out, and so he had me enter</l>
		<l>on that first circle girdling the abyss.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Here, for as much as hearing could discover,</l>
		<l>there was no outcry louder than the sighs</l>
		<l>that caused the everlasting air to tremble.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The sighs arose from sorrow without torments,</l>
		<l>out of the crowds-the many multitudes-</l>
		<l>of infants and of women and of men.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The kindly master said: &quot;Do you not ask</l>
		<l>who are these spirits whom you see before you?</l>
		<l>I&apos;d have you know, before you go ahead,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>they did not sin; and yet, though they have merits</l>
		<l>that&apos;s not enough, because they lacked baptism,</l>
		<l>the portal of the faith that you embrace.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And if they lived before Christianity,</l>
		<l>they did not worship God in fitting ways;</l>
		<l>and of such spirits I myself am one.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For these defects, and for no other evil,</l>
		<l>we now are lost and punished just with this:</l>
		<l>we have no hope and yet we live in longing.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Great sorrow seized my heart on hearing him,</l>
		<l>for I had seen some estimable men</l>
		<l>among the souls suspended in that limbo.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Tell me, my master, tell me, lord.&quot; I then</l>
		<l>began because I wanted to be certain</l>
		<l>of that belief which vanquishes all errors,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;did any ever go-by his own merit</l>
		<l>or others&apos;-from this place toward blessedness?&quot;</l>
		<l>And he, who understood my covert speech,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>replied: &quot;I was new-entered on this state</l>
		<l>when I beheld a Great Lord enter here;</l>
		<l>the crown he wore, a sign of victory.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He carried off the shade of our first father,</l>
		<l>of his son Abel, and the shade of Noah,</l>
		<l>of Moses, the obedient legislator,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of father Abraham, David the king,</l>
		<l>of Israel, his father, and his sons,</l>
		<l>and Rachel, she for whom he worked so long,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and many others-and He made them blessed;</l>
		<l>and I should have you know that, before them,</l>
		<l>there were no human souls that had been saved.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We did not stay our steps although he spoke;</l>
		<l>we still continued onward through the wood-</l>
		<l>the wood, I say, where many spirits thronged.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Our path had not gone far beyond the point</l>
		<l>where I had slept, when I beheld a fire</l>
		<l>win out against a hemisphere of shadows.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We still were at a little distance from it,</l>
		<l>but not so far I could not see in part</l>
		<l>that honorable men possessed that place.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O you who honor art and science both,</l>
		<l>who are these souls whose dignity has kept</l>
		<l>their way of being, separate from the rest?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;The honor of their name,</l>
		<l>which echoes up above within your life,</l>
		<l>gains Heaven&apos;s grace, and that advances them.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Meanwhile there was a voice that I could hear:</l>
		<l>&quot;Pay honor to the estimable poet;</l>
		<l>his shadow, which had left us, now returns.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>After that voice was done, when there was silence,</l>
		<l>I saw four giant shades approaching us;</l>
		<l>in aspect, they were neither sad nor joyous.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My kindly master then began by saying:</l>
		<l>&quot;Look well at him who holds that sword in hand</l>
		<l>who moves before the other three as lord.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That shade is Homer, the consummate poet;</l>
		<l>the other one is Horace, satirist;</l>
		<l>the third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Because each of these spirits shares with me</l>
		<l>the name called out before by the lone voice,</l>
		<l>they welcome me-and, doing that, do well.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And so I saw that splendid school assembled</l>
		<l>led by the lord of song incomparable,</l>
		<l>who like an eagle soars above the rest.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Soon after they had talked a while together,</l>
		<l>they turned to me, saluting cordially;</l>
		<l>and having witnessed this, my master smiled;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and even greater honor then was mine,</l>
		<l>for they invited me to join their ranks-</l>
		<l>I was the sixth among such intellects.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So did we move along and toward the light,</l>
		<l>talking of things about which silence here</l>
		<l>is just as seemly as our speech was there.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We reached the base of an exalted castle,</l>
		<l>encircled seven times by towering walls,</l>
		<l>defended all around by a fair stream.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We forded this as if upon hard ground;</l>
		<l>I entered seven portals with these sages;</l>
		<l>we reached a meadow of green flowering plants.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The people here had eyes both grave and slow;</l>
		<l>their features carried great authority;</l>
		<l>they spoke infrequently, with gentle voices.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We drew aside to one part of the meadow,</l>
		<l>an open place both high and filled with light,</l>
		<l>and we could see all those who were assembled.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Facing me there, on the enameled green,</l>
		<l>great-hearted souls were shown to me and I</l>
		<l>still glory in my having witnessed them.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw Electra with her many comrades,</l>
		<l>among whom I knew Hector and Aeneas,</l>
		<l>and Caesar, in his armor, falcon-eyed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw Camilla and Penthesilea</l>
		<l>and, on the other side, saw King Latinus,</l>
		<l>who sat beside Lavinia, his daughter.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin out,</l>
		<l>Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,</l>
		<l>and, solitary, set apart, Saladin.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When I had raised my eyes a little higher,</l>
		<l>I saw the master of the men who know</l>
		<l>seated in philosophic family.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There all look up to him, all do him honor:</l>
		<l>there I beheld both Socrates and Plato,</l>
		<l>closest to him, in front of all the rest;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Democritus, who ascribes the world to chance,</l>
		<l>Diogenes, Empedocles, and Zeno,</l>
		<l>and Thales, Anaxagoras, Heraclitus;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw the good collector of medicinals,</l>
		<l>I mean Dioscorides; and I saw Orpheus,</l>
		<l>and Tully, Linus, moral Seneca;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and Euclid the geometer, and Ptolemy,</l>
		<l>Hippocrates and Galen, Avicenna,</l>
		<l>Averroes, of the great Commentary.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I cannot here describe them all in full;</l>
		<l>my ample theme impels me onward so:</l>
		<l>what&apos;s told is often less than the event.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The company of six divides in two;</l>
		<l>my knowing guide leads me another way,</l>
		<l>beyond the quiet, into trembling air.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I have reached a part where no thing gleams.</l>
