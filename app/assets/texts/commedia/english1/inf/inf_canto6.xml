		<l>Upon my mind&apos;s reviving-it had closed</l>
		<l>on hearing the lament of those two kindred,</l>
		<l>since sorrow had confounded me completely-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I see new sufferings, new sufferers</l>
		<l>surrounding me on every side, wherever</l>
		<l>I move or turn about or set my eyes.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I am in the third circle, filled with cold,</l>
		<l>unending, heavy, and accursed rain;</l>
		<l>its measure and its kind are never changed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Gross hailstones, water gray with filth, and snow</l>
		<l>come streaking down across the shadowed air;</l>
		<l>the earth, as it receives that shower, stinks.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Over the souls of those submerged beneath</l>
		<l>that mess, is an outlandish, vicious beast,</l>
		<l>his three throats barking, doglike: Cerberus.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His eyes are bloodred; greasy, black, his beard;</l>
		<l>his belly bulges, and his hands are claws;</l>
		<l>his talons tear and flay and rend the shades.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That downpour makes the sinners howl like dogs;</l>
		<l>they use one of their sides to screen the other-</l>
		<l>those miserable wretches turn and turn.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When Cerberus, the great worm, noticed us,</l>
		<l>he opened wide his mouths, showed us his fangs;</l>
		<l>there was no part of him that did not twitch.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My guide opened his hands to their full span,</l>
		<l>plucked up some earth, and with his fists filled f</l>
		<l>he hurled it straight into those famished jaws.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as a dog that barks with greedy hunger</l>
		<l>will then fall quiet when he gnaws his food,</l>
		<l>intent and straining hard to cram it in,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so were the filthy faces of the demon</l>
		<l>Cerberus transformed-after he&apos;d stunned</l>
		<l>the spirits so, they wished that they were deaf.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We walked across the shades on whom there thuds</l>
		<l>that heavy rain, and set our soles upon</l>
		<l>their empty images that seem like persons.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And all those spirits lay upon the ground,</l>
		<l>except for one who sat erect as soon</l>
		<l>as he caught sight of us in front of him.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O you who are conducted through this Hell,&quot;</l>
		<l>he said to me, &quot;recall me, if you can;</l>
		<l>for you, before I was unmade, were made.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I to him: &quot;It is perhaps your anguish</l>
		<l>that snatches you out of my memory,</l>
		<l>so that it seems that I have never seen you.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But tell me who you are, you who are set</l>
		<l>in such a dismal place, such punishment-</l>
		<l>if other pains are more, none&apos;s more disgusting.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;Your city-one so full</l>
		<l>of envy that its sack has always spilled-</l>
		<l>that city held me in the sunlit life.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The name you citizens gave me was Ciacco;</l>
		<l>and for the damning sin of gluttony,</l>
		<l>as you can see, I languish in the rain.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I, a wretched soul, am not alone,</l>
		<l>for all of these have this same penalty</l>
		<l>for this same sin.&quot; And he said nothing more.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I answered him: &quot;Ciacco, your suffering</l>
		<l>so weights on me that I am forced to weep;</l>
		<l>but tell me, if you know, what end awaits</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the citizens of that divided city;</l>
		<l>is any just man there? Tell me the reason</l>
		<l>why it has been assailed by so much schism.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;After long controversy,</l>
		<l>they&apos;ll come to blood; the party of the woods</l>
		<l>will chase the other out with much offense.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But then, within three suns, they too must fall;</l>
		<l>at which the other party will prevail,</l>
		<l>using the power of one who tacks his sails.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This party will hold high its head for long</l>
		<l>and heap great weights upon its enemies,</l>
		<l>however much they weep indignantly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Two men are just, but no one listens to them.</l>
		<l>Three sparks that set on fire every heart</l>
		<l>are envy, pride, and avariciousness.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>With this, his words, inciting tears, were done;</l>
		<l>and I to him: &quot;I would learn more from you;</l>
		<l>I ask you for a gift of further speech:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Tegghiaio, Farinata, men so worthy,</l>
		<l>Arrigo, Mosca, Jacopo Rusticucci,</l>
		<l>and all the rest whose minds bent toward the good,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>do tell me where they are and let me meet them;</l>
		<l>for my great longing drives me on to learn</l>
		<l>if Heaven sweetens or Hell poisons them.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he: &quot;They are among the blackest souls;</l>
		<l>a different sin has dragged them to the bottom;</l>
		<l>if you descend so low, there you can see them.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But when you have returned to the sweet world,</l>
		<l>I pray, recall me to men&apos;s memory:</l>
		<l>I say no more to you, answer no more.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then his straight gaze grew twisted and awry;</l>
		<l>he looked at me awhile, then bent his head;</l>
		<l>he fell as low as all his blind companions.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And my guide said to me: &quot;He&apos;ll rise no more</l>
		<l>until the blast of the angelic trumpet</l>
		<l>upon the coming of the hostile Judge:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>each one shall see his sorry tomb again</l>
		<l>and once again take on his flesh and form,</l>
		<l>and hear what shall resound eternally.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So did we pass across that squalid mixture</l>
		<l>of shadows and of rain, our steps slowed down,</l>
		<l>talking awhile about the life to come.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At which I said: &quot;And after the great sentence-</l>
		<l>o master-will these torments grow, or else</l>
		<l>be less, or will they be just as intense?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;Remember now your science,</l>
		<l>which says that when a thing has more perfection,</l>
		<l>so much the greater is its pain or pleasure.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Though these accursed sinners never shall</l>
		<l>attain the true perfection, yet they can</l>
		<l>expect to be more perfect then than now.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We took the circling way traced by that road;</l>
		<l>we said much more than I can here recount;</l>
		<l>we reached the point that marks the downward slope</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Here we found Plutus, the great enemy.</l>
	</p>
