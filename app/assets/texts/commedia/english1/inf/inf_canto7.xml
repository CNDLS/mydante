	<p>
		<l>&quot;Pape Satan, Pape Satan aleppe!&quot;</l>
		<l>so Plutus, with his grating voice, began.</l>
		<l>The gentle sage, aware of everything,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>said reassuringly, &quot;Don&apos;t let your fear</l>
		<l>defeat you; for whatever power he has,</l>
		<l>he cannot stop our climbing down this crag.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then he turned back to Plutus&apos; swollen face</l>
		<l>and said to him: &quot;Be quiet, cursed wolf!</l>
		<l>Let your vindictiveness feed on yourself.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His is no random journey to the deep:</l>
		<l>it has been willed on high, where Michael took</l>
		<l>revenge upon the arrogant rebellion.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As sails inflated by the wind collapse,</l>
		<l>entangled in a heap, when the mast cracks,</l>
		<l>so that ferocious beast fell to the ground.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus we made our way down to the fourth ditch,</l>
		<l>to take in more of that despondent shore</l>
		<l>where all the universe&apos;s ill is stored.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Justice of God! Who has amassed as many</l>
		<l>strange tortures and travails as I have seen?</l>
		<l>Why do we let our guilt consume us so?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even as waves that break above Charybdis,</l>
		<l>each shattering the other when they meet,</l>
		<l>so must the spirits here dance their round dance.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Here, more than elsewhere, I saw multitudes</l>
		<l>to every side of me; their howls were loud</l>
		<l>while, wheeling weights, they used their chests to</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>They struck against each other; at that point,</l>
		<l>each turned around and, wheeling back those weight</l>
		<l>cried out: &quot;Why do you hoard?&quot; &quot;Why do you squande</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So did they move around the sorry circle</l>
		<l>from left and right to the opposing point;</l>
		<l>again, again they cried their chant of scorn;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and so, when each of them had changed positions,</l>
		<l>he circled halfway back to his next joust.</l>
		<l>And I, who felt my heart almost pierced through,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>requested: &quot;Master, show me now what shades</l>
		<l>are these and tell me if they all were clerics-</l>
		<l>those tonsured ones who circle on our left.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;All these, to left and right</l>
		<l>were so squint-eyed of mind in the first life-</l>
		<l>no spending that they did was done with measure.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Their voices bark this out with clarity</l>
		<l>when they have reached the two points of the circl</l>
		<l>where their opposing guilts divide their ranks.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These to the left-their heads bereft of hair-</l>
		<l>were clergymen, and popes and cardinals,</l>
		<l>within whom avarice works its excess.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I to him: &quot;Master, among this kind</l>
		<l>I certainly might hope to recognize</l>
		<l>some who have been bespattered by these crimes.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;That thought of yours is empty:</l>
		<l>the undiscerning life that made them filthy</l>
		<l>now renders them unrecognizable.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For all eternity they&apos;ll come to blows:</l>
		<l>these here will rise up from their sepulchers</l>
		<l>with fists clenched tight; and these, with hair cr</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Ill giving and ill keeping have robbed both</l>
		<l>of the fair world and set them to this fracas-</l>
		<l>what that is like, my words need not embellish.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now you can see, my son, how brief&apos;s the sport</l>
		<l>of all those goods that are in Fortune&apos;s care,</l>
		<l>for which the tribe of men contend and brawl;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for all the gold that is or ever was</l>
		<l>beneath the moon could never offer rest</l>
		<l>to even one of these exhausted spirits.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Master,&quot; I asked of him, &quot;now tell me too:</l>
		<l>this Fortune whom you&apos;ve touched upon just now-</l>
		<l>what&apos;s she, who clutches so all the world&apos;s goods?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;O unenlightened creatures,</l>
		<l>how deep-the ignorance that hampers you!</l>
		<l>I want you to digest my word on this.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Who made the heavens and who gave them guides</l>
		<l>was He whose wisdom transcends everything;</l>
		<l>that every part may shine unto the other,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He had the light apportioned equally;</l>
		<l>similarly, for wordly splendors, He</l>
		<l>ordained a general minister and guide</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to shift, from time to time, those empty goods</l>
		<l>from nation unto nation, clan to clan,</l>
		<l>in ways that human reason can&apos;t prevent;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>just so, one people rules, one languishes,</l>
		<l>obeying the decision she has given,</l>
		<l>which, like a serpent in the grass, is hidden.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Your knowledge cannot stand against her force;</l>
		<l>for she foresees and judges and maintains</l>
		<l>her kingdom as the other gods do theirs.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The changes that she brings are without respite:</l>
		<l>it is necessity that makes her swift;</l>
		<l>and for this reason, men change state so often.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>She is the one so frequently maligned</l>
		<l>even by those who should give praise to her-</l>
		<l>they blame her wrongfully with words of scorn.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But she is blessed and does not hear these things;</l>
		<l>for with the other primal beings, happy,</l>
		<l>she turns her sphere and glories in her bliss.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But now let us descend to greater sorrow,</l>
		<l>for every star that rose when I first moved</l>
		<l>is setting now; we cannot stay too long.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We crossed the circle to the other shore;</l>
		<l>we reached a foaming watercourse that spills</l>
		<l>into a trench formed by its overflow.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That stream was even darker than deep purple;</l>
		<l>and we, together with those shadowed waves,</l>
		<l>moved downward and along a strange pathway.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When it has reached the foot of those malign</l>
		<l>gray slopes, that melancholy stream descends,</l>
		<l>forming a swamp that bears the name of Styx.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I, who was intent on watching it,</l>
		<l>could make out muddied people in that slime,</l>
		<l>all naked and their faces furious.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These struck each other not with hands alone,</l>
		<l>but with their heads and chests and with their fee</l>
		<l>and tore each other piecemeal with their teeth.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The kindly master told me: &quot;Son, now see</l>
		<l>the souls of those whom anger has defeated;</l>
		<l>and I should also have you know for certain</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that underneath the water there are souls</l>
		<l>who sigh and make this plain of water bubble,</l>
		<l>as your eye, looking anywhere, can tell.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Wedged in the slime, they say: &apos;We had been sullen</l>
		<l>in the sweet air that&apos;s gladdened by the sun;</l>
		<l>we bore the mist of sluggishness in us:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>now we are bitter in the blackened mud.&apos;</l>
		<l>This hymn they have to gurgle in their gullets,</l>
		<l>because they cannot speak it in full words.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And so, between the dry shore and the swamp,</l>
		<l>we circled much of that disgusting pond,</l>
		<l>our eyes upon the swallowers of slime.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We came at last upon a tower&apos;s base.</l>
	</p>
