	<p>
		<l>Gazing upon His Son with that Love which</l>
		<l>One and the Other breathe eternally,</l>
		<l>the Power-first and inexpressible-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>made everything that wheels through mind and space</l>
		<l>so orderly that one who contemplates</l>
		<l>that harmony cannot but taste of Him.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then, reader, lift your eyes with me to see</l>
		<l>the high wheels; gaze directly at that part</l>
		<l>where the one motion strikes against the other;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and there begin to look with longing at</l>
		<l>that Master&apos;s art, which in Himself he loves</l>
		<l>so much that his eye never parts from it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>See there the circle branching from that cross-poi</l>
		<l>obliquely: zodiac to bear the planets</l>
		<l>that satisfy the world in need of them.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For if the planets&apos; path were not aslant,</l>
		<l>much of the heavens&apos; virtue would be wasted</l>
		<l>and almost every power on earth be dead;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and if the zodiac swerved more or less</l>
		<l>far from the straight course, then earth&apos;s harmony</l>
		<l>would be defective in both hemispheres.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now, reader, do not leave your bench, but stay</l>
		<l>to think on that of which you have foretaste;</l>
		<l>you will have much delight before you tire.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I have prepared your fare; now feed yourself,</l>
		<l>because that matter of which I am made</l>
		<l>the scribe calls all my care unto itself.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The greatest minister of nature-he</l>
		<l>who imprints earth with heaven&apos;s worth and, with</l>
		<l>his light, provides the measurement for time-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>since he was in conjunction with the part</l>
		<l>I noted, now was wheeling through the spirals</l>
		<l>where he appears more early every day.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I was with him, but no more aware</l>
		<l>of the ascent than one can be aware</l>
		<l>of any sudden thought before it starts.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The one who guides me so from good to better</l>
		<l>is Beatrice, and on our path her acts</l>
		<l>have so much swiftness that they span no time.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>How bright within themselves must be the lights</l>
		<l>I saw on entering the Sun, for they</l>
		<l>were known to me by splendor, not by color!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Though I should call on talent, craft, and practic</l>
		<l>my telling cannot help them be imagined;</l>
		<l>but you can trust-and may you long to see it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And if our fantasies fall short before</l>
		<l>such heights, there is no need to wonder; for</l>
		<l>no eye has seen light brighter than the Sun&apos;s.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Such was the sphere of His fourth family,</l>
		<l>whom the High Father always satisfies,</l>
		<l>showing how He engenders and breathes forth.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And Beatrice began: &quot;Give thanks, give thanks</l>
		<l>to Him, the angels&apos; Sun, who, through His grace,</l>
		<l>has lifted you to this embodied sun.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No mortal heart was ever so disposed</l>
		<l>to worship, or so quick to yield itself</l>
		<l>to God with all its gratefulness, as I</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>was when I heard those words, and all my love</l>
		<l>was so intent on Him that Beatrice</l>
		<l>was then eclipsed within forgetfulness.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And she was not displeased, but smiled at this,</l>
		<l>so that the splendor of her smiling eyes</l>
		<l>divided my rapt mind between two objects.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I saw many lights, alive, most bright;</l>
		<l>we formed the center, they became a crown,</l>
		<l>their voices even sweeter than their splendor:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>just so, at times, we see Latona&apos;s daughter</l>
		<l>circled when saturated air holds fast</l>
		<l>the thread that forms the girdle of her halo.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>In Heaven&apos;s court, from which I have returned,</l>
		<l>one finds so many fair and precious gems</l>
		<l>that are not to be taken from that kingdom:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>one of those gems, the song those splendors sang.</l>
		<l>He who does not take wings to reach that realm,</l>
		<l>may wait for tidings of it from the mute.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>After those ardent suns, while singing so,</l>
		<l>had wheeled three times around us, even as</l>
		<l>stars that are close to the fixed poles, they seem</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to me like women who, though not released</l>
		<l>from dancing, pause in silence, listening</l>
		<l>until new notes invite to new dancing.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And from within one light I heard begin:</l>
		<l>&quot;Because the ray of grace, from which true love</l>
		<l>is kindled first and then, in loving, grows,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>shines with such splendor, multiplied, in you,</l>
		<l>that it has led you up the stair that none</l>
		<l>descends who will not climb that stair again,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>whoever would refuse to quench your thirst</l>
		<l>with wine from his flask, would be no more free</l>
		<l>than water that does not flow toward the sea.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You want to know what plants bloom in this garland</l>
		<l>that, circling, contemplates with love the fair</l>
		<l>lady who strengthens your ascent to heaven.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I was a lamb among the holy flock</l>
		<l>that Dominic leads on the path where one</l>
		<l>may fatten well if one does not stray off.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He who is nearest on my right was both</l>
		<l>my brother and my teacher: from Cologne,</l>
		<l>Albert, and I am Thomas of Aquino.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If you would know who all the others are,</l>
		<l>then even as I speak let your eyes follow,</l>
		<l>making their way around the holy wreath.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That next flame issues from the smile of Gratian,</l>
		<l>who served one and the other court of law</l>
		<l>so well that his work pleases Paradise.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That other, who adorns our choir next-</l>
		<l>he was that Peter who, like the poor widow,</l>
		<l>offered his treasure to the Holy Church.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The fifth light, and the fairest light among us,</l>
		<l>breathes forth such love that all the world below</l>
		<l>hungers for tidings of it; in that flame</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>there is the lofty mind where such profound</l>
		<l>wisdom was placed that, if the truth be true,</l>
		<l>no other ever rose with so much vision.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Next you can see the radiance of that candle</l>
		<l>which, in the flesh, below, beheld most deeply</l>
		<l>the angels&apos; nature and their ministry.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Within the other little light there smiles</l>
		<l>that champion of the Christian centuries</l>
		<l>whose narrative was used by Augustine.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now, if your mind&apos;s eye, following my praising,</l>
		<l>was drawn from light to light, you must already</l>
		<l>be thirsting for the eighth: within that light,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>because he saw the Greatest Good, rejoices</l>
		<l>the blessed soul who makes the world&apos;s deceit</l>
		<l>most plain to all who hear him carefully.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The flesh from which his soul was banished lies</l>
		<l>below, within Cieldauro, and he came</l>
		<l>from martyrdom and exile to this peace.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Beyond, you see, flaming, the ardent spirits</l>
		<l>of Isidore and Bede and Richard-he</l>
		<l>whose meditation made him more than man.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This light from whom your gaze returns to me</l>
		<l>contains a spirit whose oppressive thoughts</l>
		<l>made him see death as coming much too slowly:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>it is the everlasting light of Siger,</l>
		<l>who when he lectured in the Street of Straw</l>
		<l>demonstrated truths that earned him envy.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then, like a clock that calls us at the hour</l>
		<l>in which the Bride of God, on waking, sings</l>
		<l>matins to her Bridegroom, encouraging</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His love (when each clock-part both drives and dra</l>
		<l>chiming the sounds with notes so sweet that those</l>
		<l>with spirit well-disposed feel their love grow;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so did I see the wheel that moved in glory</l>
		<l>go round and render voice to voice with such</l>
		<l>sweetness and such accord that they can not</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>be known except where joy is everlasting.</l>
