		<l>Let him imagine, who would rightly seize</l>
		<l>what I saw now-and let him while I speak</l>
		<l>retain that image like a steadfast rock-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>in heaven&apos;s different parts, those fifteen stars</l>
		<l>that quicken heaven with such radiance</l>
		<l>as to undo the air&apos;s opacities;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>let him imagine, too, that Wain which stays</l>
		<l>within our heaven&apos;s bosom night and day,</l>
		<l>so that its turning never leaves our sight;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>let him imagine those two stars that form</l>
		<l>the mouth of that Horn which begins atop</l>
		<l>the axle round which the first wheel revolves;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>then see these join to form two signs in heaven-</l>
		<l>just like the constellation that was shaped</l>
		<l>by Minos&apos; daughter when she felt death&apos;s chill-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>two signs with corresponding radii,</l>
		<l>revolving so that one sign moves in one</l>
		<l>direction, and the other in a second;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and he will have a shadow-as it were-</l>
		<l>of the true constellation, the double dance</l>
		<l>that circled round the point where I was standing:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>a shadow-since its truth exceeds our senses,</l>
		<l>just as the swiftest of all heavens is</l>
		<l>more swift than the Chiana&apos;s sluggishness.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>They sang no Bacchus there, they sang no Paean,</l>
		<l>but sang three Persons in the divine nature,</l>
		<l>and in one Person the divine and human.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The singing and the dance fulfilled their measure;</l>
		<l>and then those holy lights gave heed to us,</l>
		<l>rejoicing as they turned from task to task.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The silence of the blessed fellowship</l>
		<l>was broken by the very light from which</l>
		<l>I heard the wondrous life of God&apos;s poor man;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that light said: &quot;Since one stalk is threshed, and</l>
		<l>its grain is in the granary already,</l>
		<l>sweet love leads me to thresh the other stalk.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You think that any light which human nature</l>
		<l>can rightfully possess was all infused</l>
		<l>by that Force which had shaped both of these two:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the one out of whose chest was drawn the rib</l>
		<l>from which was formed the lovely cheek whose palat</l>
		<l>was then to prove so costly to the world;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and One whose chest was transfixed by the lance,</l>
		<l>who satisfied all past and future sins,</l>
		<l>outweighing them upon the scales of justice.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Therefore you wondered at my words when I-</l>
		<l>before-said that no other ever vied</l>
		<l>with that great soul enclosed in the fifth light.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now let your eyes hold fast to my reply,</l>
		<l>and you will see: truth centers both my speech</l>
		<l>and your belief, just like a circle&apos;s center.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Both that which never dies and that which dies</l>
		<l>are only the reflected light of that</l>
		<l>Idea which our Sire, with Love, begets;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>because the living Light that pours out so</l>
		<l>from Its bright Source that It does not disjoin</l>
		<l>from It or from the Love intrined with them,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>through Its own goodness gathers up Its rays</l>
		<l>within nine essences, as in a mirror,</l>
		<l>Itself eternally remaining One.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>down to the last potentialities,</l>
		<l>From there, from act to act, light then descends</l>
		<l>where it is such that it engenders nothing</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but brief contingent things, by which I mean</l>
		<l>the generated things the moving heavens</l>
		<l>bring into being, with or without seed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The wax of such things and what shapes that wax</l>
		<l>are not immutable; and thus, beneath</l>
		<l>Idea&apos;s stamp, light shines through more or less.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus it can be that, in the selfsame species,</l>
		<l>some trees bear better fruit and some bear worse,</l>
		<l>and men are born with different temperaments.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For were the wax appropriately readied,</l>
		<l>and were the heaven&apos;s power at its height,</l>
		<l>the brightness of the seal would show completely;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but Nature always works defectively-</l>
		<l>she passes on that light much like an artist</l>
		<l>who knows his craft but has a hand that trembles.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Yet where the ardent Love prepares and stamps</l>
		<l>the lucid Vision of the primal Power,</l>
		<l>a being then acquires complete perfection.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>In that way, earth was once made worthy of</l>
		<l>the full perfection of a living being;</l>
		<l>thus was the Virgin made to be with child.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So that I do approve of the opinion</l>
		<l>you hold: that human nature never was</l>
		<l>nor shall be what it was in those two persons.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now if I said no more beyond this point,</l>
		<l>your words might well begin, &apos;How is it, then,</l>
		<l>with your assertion of his matchless vision?&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But so that the obscure can be made plain,</l>
		<l>consider who he was, what was the cause</l>
		<l>of his request when he was told, &apos;Do ask.&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My words did not prevent your seeing clearly</l>
		<l>that it was as a king that he had asked</l>
		<l>for wisdom that would serve his royal task-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and not to know the number of the angels</l>
		<l>on high or, if combined with a contingent,</l>
		<l>necesse ever can produce necesse,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>or si est dare primum motum esse,</l>
		<l>or if, within a semicircle, one</l>
		<l>can draw a triangle with no right angle.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus, if you note both what I said and say,</l>
		<l>by &apos;matchless vision&apos; it is kingly prudence</l>
		<l>my arrow of intention means to strike;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and if you turn clear eyes to that word &apos;rose,&apos;</l>
		<l>you&apos;ll see that it referred to kings alone-</l>
		<l>kings, who are many, and the good are rare.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Take what I said with this distinction then;</l>
		<l>in that way it accords with what you thought</l>
		<l>of the first father and of our Beloved.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And let this weigh as lead to slow your steps,</l>
		<l>to make you move as would a weary man</l>
		<l>to yes or no when you do not see clearly:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>whether he would affirm or would deny,</l>
		<l>he who decides without distinguishing</l>
		<l>must be among the most obtuse of men;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>opinion-hasty-often can incline</l>
		<l>to the wrong side, and then affection for</l>
		<l>one&apos;s own opinion binds, confines the mind.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Far worse than uselessly he leaves the shore</l>
		<l>(more full of error than he was before)</l>
		<l>who fishes for the truth but lacks the art.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Of this, Parmenides, Melissus, Bryson,</l>
		<l>are clear proofs to the world, and many others</l>
		<l>who went their way but knew not where it went;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so did Sabellius and Arius</l>
		<l>and other fools-like concave blades that mirror-</l>
		<l>who rendered crooked the straight face of Scriptur</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So, too, let men not be too confident</l>
		<l>in judging-witness those who, in the field,</l>
		<l>would count the ears before the corn is ripe;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for I have seen, all winter through, the brier</l>
		<l>display itself as stiff and obstinate,</l>
		<l>and later, on its summit, bear the rose;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and once I saw a ship sail straight and swift</l>
		<l>through all its voyaging across the sea,</l>
		<l>then perish at the end, at harbor entry.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Let not Dame Bertha or Master Martin think</l>
		<l>that they have shared God&apos;s Counsel when they see</l>
		<l>one rob and see another who donates:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the last may fall, the other may be saved.&quot;</l>
