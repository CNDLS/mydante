		<l>If here below, where sentiment is far</l>
		<l>too weak to withstand error, I should see</l>
		<l>men glorying in you, nobility</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of blood-a meager thing!-I should not wonder,</l>
		<l>for even where desire is not awry,</l>
		<l>I mean in Heaven, I too felt such pride.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You are indeed a cloak that soon wears out,</l>
		<l>so that if, day by day, we add no patch,</l>
		<l>then circling time will trim you with its shears.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My speech began again with you, the word</l>
		<l>that Rome was the first city to allow,</l>
		<l>although her people seldom speak it now;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>at this word, Beatrice, somewhat apart,</l>
		<l>smiling, seemed like the woman who had coughed-</l>
		<l>so goes the tale-at Guinevere&apos;s first fault.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So did my speech begin: &quot;You are my father;</l>
		<l>you hearten me to speak with confidence;</l>
		<l>you raise me so that I am more than I.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So many streams have filled my mind with gladness-</l>
		<l>so many, and such gladness, that mind must</l>
		<l>rejoice that it can bear this and not burst.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then tell me, founder of my family,</l>
		<l>who were your ancestors and, in your boyhood,</l>
		<l>what were the years the records registered;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and tell me of the sheepfold of St. John-</l>
		<l>how numerous it was, who in that flock</l>
		<l>were worthy of the highest offices.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As at the breathing of the winds, a coal</l>
		<l>will quicken into flame, so I saw that</l>
		<l>light glow at words that were affectionate;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and as, before my eyes, it grew more fair,</l>
		<l>so, with a voice more gentle and more sweet-</l>
		<l>not in our modern speech-it said to me:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Down from that day when Ave was pronounced,</l>
		<l>until my mother (blessed now), by giving</l>
		<l>birth, eased the burden borne in bearing me,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>this fire of Mars had come five-hundred-fifty</l>
		<l>and thirty more times to its Lion-there</l>
		<l>to be rekindled underneath its paw.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My ancestors and I were born just where</l>
		<l>the runner in your yearly games first comes</l>
		<l>upon the boundary of the final ward.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That is enough concerning my forebears:</l>
		<l>what were their names, from where they came-of tha</l>
		<l>silence, not speech, is more appropriate.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>All those who, at that time, between the Baptist</l>
		<l>and Mars, were capable of bearing arms,</l>
		<l>numbered one fifth of those who live there now.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But then the citizens, now mixed with Campi,</l>
		<l>with the Certaldo, and with the Figline,</l>
		<l>were pure down to the humblest artisan.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Oh, it would be far better if you had</l>
		<l>those whom I mention as your neighbors (and</l>
		<l>your boundaries at Galuzzo and Trespiano),</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>than to have them within, to bear the stench</l>
		<l>of Aguglione&apos;s wretch and Signa&apos;s wretch,</l>
		<l>whose sharp eyes now on barratry are set.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If those who, in the world, go most astray</l>
		<l>had not seen Caesar with stepmothers&apos; eyes,</l>
		<l>but, like a mother to her son, been kind,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>then one who has become a Florentine</l>
		<l>trader and money changer would have stayed</l>
		<l>in Semifonte, where his fathers peddled,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the Counts would still be lords of Montemurlo,</l>
		<l>the Cerchi would be in Acone&apos;s parish,</l>
		<l>perhaps the Buondelmonti in Valdigreve.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The mingling of the populations led</l>
		<l>to evil in the city, even as</l>
		<l>food piled on food destroys the body&apos;s health;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the blind bull falls more quickly, more headlong,</l>
		<l>than does the blind lamb; and the one blade can</l>
		<l>often cut more and better than five swords.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Consider Luni, Urbisaglia, how</l>
		<l>they went to ruin (Sinigaglia follows,</l>
		<l>and Chiusi, too, will soon have vanished); then,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>if you should hear of families undone,</l>
		<l>you will find nothing strange or difficult</l>
		<l>in that-since even cities meet their end.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>All things that you possess, possess their death,</l>
		<l>just as you do; but in some things that last</l>
		<l>long, death can hide from you whose lives are shor</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And even as the heaven of the moon,</l>
		<l>revolving, respiteless, conceals and then</l>
		<l>reveals the shores, so Fortune does with Florence;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>therefore, there is no cause for wonder in</l>
		<l>what I shall tell of noble Florentines,</l>
		<l>of those whose reputations time has hidden.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw the Ughi, saw the Catellini,</l>
		<l>Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, Alberichi,</l>
		<l>famed citizens already in decline,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and saw, as great as they were venerable,</l>
		<l>dell&apos;Arca with della Sannella, and</l>
		<l>Ardinghi, Soldanieri, and Bostichi.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Nearby the gate that now is burdened with</l>
		<l>new treachery that weighs so heavily</l>
		<l>that it will bring the vessel to shipwreck,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>there were the Ravignani, from whose line</l>
		<l>Count Guido comes and all who-since-derive</l>
		<l>their name from the illustrious Bellincione.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And della Pressa knew already how</l>
		<l>to rule; and Galigaio, in his house,</l>
		<l>already had the gilded hilt and pommel.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The stripe of Vair had mightiness already,</l>
		<l>as did the Giuochi, Galli, and Barucci,</l>
		<l>Fifanti, and Sacchetti, and those who</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>blush for the bushel; and the stock from which</l>
		<l>spring the Calfucci was already mighty,</l>
		<l>and Sizzi and Arrigucci were already</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>raised to high office. Oh, how great were those</l>
		<l>I saw-whom pride laid low! And the gold balls,</l>
		<l>in all of her great actions, flowered Florence.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Such were the ancestors of those who now,</l>
		<l>whenever bishops&apos; sees are vacant, grow</l>
		<l>fat as they sit in church consistories.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The breed-so arrogant and dragonlike</l>
		<l>in chasing him who flees, but lamblike, meek</l>
		<l>to him who shows his teeth or else his purse-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>was on the rise already, but of stock</l>
		<l>so mean that Ubertin Donato, when</l>
		<l>his father-in-law made him kin to them,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>was scarcely pleased. Already Caponsacco</l>
		<l>had come from Fiesole down to the market;</l>
		<l>already citizens of note were Giuda</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and Infangato. I shall tell a thing</l>
		<l>incredible and true: the gateway through</l>
		<l>the inner walls was named for the della Pera.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>All those whose arms bear part of the fair ensign</l>
		<l>of the great baron-he whose memory</l>
		<l>and worth are honored on the feast of Thomas-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>received knighthood and privilege from him,</l>
		<l>though he whose coat of arms has fringed that ensi</l>
		<l>has taken sides now with the populace.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The Gualterotti and the Importuni</l>
		<l>were there already; were the Borgo spared</l>
		<l>new neighbors, it would still be tranquil there.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The house of Amidei, with which your sorrows</l>
		<l>began-by reason of its just resentment,</l>
		<l>which ruined you and ended years of gladness-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>was honored then, as were its close companions.</l>
		<l>O Buondelmonte, through another&apos;s counsel,</l>
		<l>you fled your wedding pledge, and brought such evi</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Many would now rejoice, who still lament,</l>
		<l>if when you first approached the city, God</l>
		<l>had given you unto the river Ema!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But Florence, in her final peace, was fated</l>
		<l>to offer up-unto that mutilated</l>
		<l>stone guardian upon her bridge-a victim.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These were the families, and others with them:</l>
		<l>the Florence that I saw-in such repose</l>
		<l>that there was nothing to have caused her sorrow.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These were the families: with them I saw</l>
		<l>her people so acclaimed and just, that on</l>
		<l>her staff the lily never was reversed,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>nor was it made bloodred by factious hatred.&quot;</l>
