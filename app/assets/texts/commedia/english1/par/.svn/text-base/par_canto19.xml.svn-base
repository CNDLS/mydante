	<p>
		<l>The handsome image those united souls,</l>
		<l>happy within their blessedness, were shaping,</l>
		<l>appeared before me now with open wings.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Each soul seemed like a ruby-one in which</l>
		<l>a ray of sun burned so, that in my eyes,</l>
		<l>it was the total sun that seemed reflected.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And what I now must tell has never been</l>
		<l>reported by a voice, inscribed by ink,</l>
		<l>never conceived by the imagination;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for I did see the beak, did hear it speak</l>
		<l>and utter with its voice both I and mine</l>
		<l>when we and ours were what, in thought, was meant.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And it began: &quot;Because I was both just</l>
		<l>and merciful, I am exalted here</l>
		<l>to glory no desire can surpass;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the memory I left on earth is such</l>
		<l>that even the malicious praise it there,</l>
		<l>although they do not follow its example.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus one sole warmth is felt from many embers,</l>
		<l>even as from a multitude of loves</l>
		<l>one voice alone rose from the Eagle&apos;s image.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>To which I said: &quot;O everlasting flowers</l>
		<l>of the eternal gladness, who make all</l>
		<l>your fragrances appear to me as one,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>do let your breath deliver me from that</l>
		<l>great fast which kept me hungering so long,</l>
		<l>not finding any food for it on earth.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I know indeed that, though God&apos;s Justice has</l>
		<l>another realm in Heaven as Its mirror,</l>
		<l>you here do not perceive it through a veil.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You know how keenly I prepare myself</l>
		<l>to listen, and you know what is that doubt</l>
		<l>which caused so old a hungering in me.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just like a falcon set free from its hood,</l>
		<l>which moves its head and flaps its wings, displayi</l>
		<l>its eagerness and proud appearance, so</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw that ensign do, that Eagle woven</l>
		<l>of praises of God&apos;s grace, accompanied</l>
		<l>by songs whose sense those up above enjoy.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then it began: &quot;The One who turned His compass</l>
		<l>to mark the world&apos;s confines, and in them set</l>
		<l>so many things concealed and things revealed,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>could not imprint His Power into all</l>
		<l>the universe without His Word remaining</l>
		<l>in infinite excess of such a vessel.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>In proof of this, the first proud being, he</l>
		<l>who was the highest of all creatures, fell-</l>
		<l>unripe because he did not wait for light.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus it is clear that every lesser nature</l>
		<l>is-all the more-too meager a container</l>
		<l>for endless Good, which is Its own sole measure.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>In consequence of this, your vision-which</l>
		<l>must be a ray of that Intelligence</l>
		<l>with which all beings are infused-cannot</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of its own nature find sufficient force</l>
		<l>to see into its origin beyond</l>
		<l>what God himself makes manifest to man;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>therefore, the vision that your world receives</l>
		<l>can penetrate into Eternal Justice</l>
		<l>no more than eye can penetrate the sea;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for though, near shore, sight reaches the sea floo</l>
		<l>you cannot reach it in the open sea;</l>
		<l>yet it is there, but hidden by the deep.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Only the light that shines from the clear heaven</l>
		<l>can never be obscured-all else is darkness</l>
		<l>or shadow of the flesh or fleshly poison.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now is the hiding place of living Justice</l>
		<l>laid open to you-where it had been hidden</l>
		<l>while you addressed it with insistent questions.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For you would say: &apos;A man is born along</l>
		<l>the shoreline of the Indus River; none</l>
		<l>is there to speak or teach or write of Christ.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he, as far as human reason sees,</l>
		<l>in all he seeks and all he does is good:</l>
		<l>there is no sin within his life or speech.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And that man dies unbaptized, without faith.</l>
		<l>Where is this justice then that would condemn him?</l>
		<l>Where is his sin if he does not believe?&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now who are you to sit upon the bench,</l>
		<l>to judge events a thousand miles away,</l>
		<l>when your own vision spans so brief a space?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Of course, for him who would be subtle with me,</l>
		<l>were there no Scriptures to instruct you, then</l>
		<l>there would be place for an array of questions.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O earthly animals, o minds obtuse!</l>
		<l>The Primal Will, which of Itself is good,</l>
		<l>from the Supreme Good-Its Self-never moved.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So much is just as does accord with It;</l>
		<l>and so, created good can draw It to</l>
		<l>itself-but It, rayed forth, causes such goods.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as, above the nest, the stork will circle</l>
		<l>when she has fed her fledglings, and as he</l>
		<l>whom she has fed looks up at her, so did</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the blessed image do, and so did I,</l>
		<l>the fledgling, while the Eagle moved its wings,</l>
		<l>spurred on by many wills in unison.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Wheeling, the Eagle sang, then said: &quot;Even</l>
		<l>as are my songs to you-past understanding-</l>
		<l>such is Eternal Judgment to you mortals.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>After the Holy Ghost&apos;s bright flames fell silent</l>
		<l>while still within the sign that made the Romans</l>
		<l>revered throughout the world, again the Eagle</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>began: &quot;No one without belief in Christ</l>
		<l>has ever risen to this kingdom-either</l>
		<l>before or after He was crucified.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But there are many who now cry &apos;Christ! Christ!&apos;</l>
		<l>who at the Final Judgment shall be far</l>
		<l>less close to Him than one who knows not Christ;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the Ethiopian will shame such Christians</l>
		<l>when the two companies are separated,</l>
		<l>the one forever rich, the other poor.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>What shall the Persians, when they come to see</l>
		<l>that open volume in which they shall read</l>
		<l>the misdeeds of your rulers, say to them?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There one shall see, among the deeds of Albert,</l>
		<l>that which is soon to set the pen in motion,</l>
		<l>his making of a desert of Prague&apos;s kingdom.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There one shall see the grief inflicted on</l>
		<l>the Seine by him who falsifies his coins,</l>
		<l>one who shall die beneath a wild boar&apos;s blow.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There one shall see the thirst of arrogance</l>
		<l>that drives the Scot and Englishman insane-</l>
		<l>unable to remain within their borders.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That book will show the life of Lechery</l>
		<l>and ease the Spaniard led-and the Bohemian,</l>
		<l>who never knew and never wished for valor.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That book will show the Cripple of Jerusalem-</l>
		<l>his good deeds labeled with an I alone,</l>
		<l>whereas his evils will be under M.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That book will show the greed and cowardice</l>
		<l>of him who oversees the Isle of Fire,</l>
		<l>on which Anchises ended his long life;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and to make plain his paltriness, the letters</l>
		<l>that register his deeds will be contracted,</l>
		<l>to note much pettiness in little space.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And all shall see the filthiness of both</l>
		<l>his uncle and his brother, who dishonored</l>
		<l>a family so famous-and two crowns.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he of Portugal and he of Norway</l>
		<l>shall be known in that book, and he of Rascia,</l>
		<l>who saw-unluckily-the coin of Venice.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O happy Hungary, if she would let</l>
		<l>herself be wronged no more! Happy Navarre,</l>
		<l>if mountains that surround her served as armor!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And if Navarre needs token of her future,</l>
		<l>now Nicosia and Famagosta offer-</l>
		<l>as men must see-lament and anger over</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>their own beast, with his place beside the others.</l>
