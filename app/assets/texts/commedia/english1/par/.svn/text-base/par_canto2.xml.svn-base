	<p>
		<l>O you who are within your little bark,</l>
		<l>eager to listen, following behind</l>
		<l>my ship that, singing, crosses to deep seas,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>turn back to see your shores again: do not</l>
		<l>attempt to sail the seas I sail; you may,</l>
		<l>by losing sight of me, be left astray.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The waves I take were never sailed before;</l>
		<l>Minerva breathes, Apollo pilots me,</l>
		<l>and the nine Muses show to me the Bears.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You other few who turned your minds in time</l>
		<l>unto the bread of angels, which provides</l>
		<l>men here with life -- but hungering for more --</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>you may indeed commit your vessel to</l>
		<l>the deep salt-sea, keeping your course within</l>
		<l>my wake, ahead of where waves smooth again.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Those men of glory, those who crossed to Colchis,</l>
		<l>when they saw Jason turn into a ploughman</l>
		<l>were less amazed than you will be amazed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The thirst that is innate and everlasting --</l>
		<l>thirst for the godly realm -- bore us away</l>
		<l>as swiftly as the heavens that you see.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Beatrice gazed upward. I watched her.</l>
		<l>But in a span perhaps no longer than</l>
		<l>an arrow takes to strike, to fly, to leave</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the bow, I reached a place where I could see</l>
		<l>that something wonderful drew me; and she</l>
		<l>from whom my need could not be hidden, turned</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to me (her gladness matched her loveliness):</l>
		<l>&quot;Direct your mind to God in gratefulness,&quot;</l>
		<l>she said; &quot;He has brought us to the first star.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It seemed to me that we were covered by</l>
		<l>a brilliant, solid, dense, and stainless cloud,</l>
		<l>much like a diamond that the sun has struck.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Into itself, the everlasting pearl</l>
		<l>received us, just as water will accept</l>
		<l>a ray of light and yet remain intact.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If I was body (and on earth we can</l>
		<l>not see how things material can share</l>
		<l>one space -- the case, when body enters body),</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>then should our longing be still more inflamed</l>
		<l>to see that Essence in which we discern</l>
		<l>how God and human nature were made one.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>What we hold here by faith, shall there be seen,</l>
		<l>not demonstrated but directly known,</l>
		<l>even as the first truth that man believes.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I answered: &quot;With the most devotion I</l>
		<l>can summon, I thank Him who has brought me</l>
		<l>far from the mortal world. But now tell me:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>what are the dark marks on this planet&apos;s body</l>
		<l>that there below, on earth, have made men tell</l>
		<l>the tale of Cain?&quot; She smiled somewhat, and then</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>she said: &quot;If the opinion mortals hold</l>
		<l>falls into error when the senses&apos; key</l>
		<l>cannot unlock the truth, you should not be</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>struck by the arrows of amazement once</l>
		<l>you recognize that reason, even when</l>
		<l>supported by the senses, has short wings.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But tell me what you think of it yourself.&quot;</l>
		<l>And I: &quot;What seems to us diverse up here</l>
		<l>is caused -- I think -- by matter dense and rare.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And she: &quot;You certainly will see that your</l>
		<l>belief is deeply sunk in error if</l>
		<l>you listen carefully as I rebut it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The eighth sphere offers many lights to you,</l>
		<l>and you can tell that they, in quality</l>
		<l>and size, are stars with different visages.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If rarity and density alone</l>
		<l>caused this, then all the stars would share one power</l>
		<l>distributed in lesser, greater, or</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>in equal force. But different powers must</l>
		<l>be fruits of different formal principles;</l>
		<l>were you correct, one only would be left,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the rest, destroyed. And more, were rarity</l>
		<l>the cause of the dim spots you question, then</l>
		<l>in part this planet would lack matter through</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and through, or else as, in a body, lean</l>
		<l>and fat can alternate, so would this planet</l>
		<l>alternate the pages in its volume.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>To validate the first case, in the sun&apos;s</l>
		<l>eclipse, the light would have to show through, just</l>
		<l>as when it crosses matter that is slender.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This is not so; therefore we must consider</l>
		<l>the latter case -- if I annul that too,</l>
		<l>then your opinion surely is confuted.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If rarity does not run through and through</l>
		<l>the moon, then there must be a limit where</l>
		<l>thickness does not allow the light to pass;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>from there, the rays of sun would be thrown back,</l>
		<l>just as, from glass that hides lead at its back,</l>
		<l>a ray of colored light returns, reflected.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now you will say that where a ray has been</l>
		<l>reflected from a section farther back,</l>
		<l>that ray will show itself to be more dim.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Yet an experiment, were you to try it,</l>
		<l>could free you from your cavil -- and the source</l>
		<l>of your arts&apos; course springs from experiment.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Taking three mirrors, place a pair of them</l>
		<l>at equal distance from you; set the third</l>
		<l>midway between those two, but farther back.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then, turning toward them, at your back have placed</l>
		<l>a light that kindles those three mirrors and</l>
		<l>returns to you, reflected by them all.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Although the image in the farthest glass</l>
		<l>will be of lesser size, there you will see</l>
		<l>that it must match the brightness of the rest.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now, just as the sub-matter of the snow,</l>
		<l>beneath the blows of the warm rays, is stripped</l>
		<l>of both its former color and its cold,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so is your mind left bare of error; I</l>
		<l>would offer now to you a new form, light</l>
		<l>so living that it trembles in your sight.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Within the heaven of the godly peace</l>
		<l>revolves a body in whose power lies</l>
		<l>the being of all things that it enfolds.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The sphere that follows, where so much is shown,</l>
		<l>to varied essences bestows that being,</l>
		<l>to stars distinct and yet contained in it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The other spheres, in ways diverse, direct</l>
		<l>the diverse powers they possess, so that</l>
		<l>these forces can bear fruit, attain their aims.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So do these organs of the universe</l>
		<l>proceed, as you now see, from stage to stage,</l>
		<l>receiving from above and acting downward.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now do attend to how I pass by way</l>
		<l>of reason to the truth you want that -- then --</l>
		<l>you may learn how to cross the ford alone.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The force and motion of the holy spheres</l>
		<l>must be inspired by the blessed movers,</l>
		<l>just as the smith imparts the hammer&apos;s art;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and so, from the deep Mind that makes it wheel,</l>
		<l>the sphere that many lights adorn receives</l>
		<l>that stamp of which it then becomes the seal.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And as the soul within your dust is shared</l>
		<l>by different organs, each most suited to</l>
		<l>a different potency, so does that Mind</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>unfold and multiply its bounty through</l>
		<l>the varied heavens, though that Intellect</l>
		<l>itself revolves upon its unity.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>With the dear body that it quickens and</l>
		<l>with which, as life in you, it too is bound,</l>
		<l>each different power forms a different compound.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Because of the glad nature of its source,</l>
		<l>the power mingled with a sphere shines forth,</l>
		<l>as gladness, through the living pupil, shines.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>From this, and not from matter rare or dense,</l>
		<l>derive the differences from light to light;</l>
		<l>this is the forming principle, producing,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>conforming with its worth, the dark, the bright.&quot;</l>
