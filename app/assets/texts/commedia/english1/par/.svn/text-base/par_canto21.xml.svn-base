		<l>By now my eyes were set again upon my</l>
		<l>lady&apos;s face, and with my eyes, my mind:</l>
		<l>from every other thought, it was withdrawn.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>She did not smile. Instead her speech to me</l>
		<l>began: &quot;Were I to smile, then you would be</l>
		<l>like Semele when she was turned to ashes,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>because, as you have seen, my loveliness-</l>
		<l>which, even as we climb the steps of this</l>
		<l>eternal palace, blazes with more brightness-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>were it not tempered here, would be so brilliant</l>
		<l>that, as it flashed, your mortal faculty</l>
		<l>would seem a branch a lightning bolt has cracked.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We now are in the seventh splendor; this,</l>
		<l>beneath the burning Lion&apos;s breast, transmits</l>
		<l>to earth its rays, with which his force is mixed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Let your mind follow where your eyes have led,</l>
		<l>and let your eyes be mirrors for the figure</l>
		<l>that will appear to you within this mirror.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That man who knows just how my vision pastured</l>
		<l>upon her blessed face, might recognize</l>
		<l>the joy I found when my celestial guide</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>had asked of me to turn my mind aside,</l>
		<l>were he to weigh my joy when I obeyed</l>
		<l>against my joy in contemplating her.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Within the crystal that-as it revolves</l>
		<l>around the earth-bears as its name the name</l>
		<l>of that dear king whose rule undid all evil,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw a ladder rising up so high</l>
		<l>that it could not be followed by my sight:</l>
		<l>its color, gold when gold is struck by sunlight.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I also saw so many flames descend</l>
		<l>those steps that I thought every light displayed</l>
		<l>in heaven had been poured out from that place.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And just as jackdaws, at the break of day,</l>
		<l>together rise-such is their nature&apos;s way-</l>
		<l>to warm their feathers chilled by night; then some</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>fly off and never do return, and some</l>
		<l>wheel back to that point where they started from,</l>
		<l>while others, though they wheel, remain at home;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>such were the ways I saw those splendors take</l>
		<l>as soon as they had struck a certain step,</l>
		<l>where they had thronged as one in radiance.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The flame that halted nearest us became</l>
		<l>so bright that in my mind I said: &quot;I see</l>
		<l>you clearly signaling to me your love.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But she from whom I wait for word on how</l>
		<l>and when to speak and to be silent, pauses;</l>
		<l>thus, though I would, I do well not to ask.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And she who, seeing Him who sees all things,</l>
		<l>had seen the reason for my silence, said</l>
		<l>to me: &quot;Do satisfy your burning longing.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I began: &quot;My merit does not make</l>
		<l>me worthy of reply, but for the sake</l>
		<l>of her who gives me leave to question you-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>a blessed living soul-who hide within</l>
		<l>your joy, do let me know the reason why</l>
		<l>you drew so near to me. And tell me, too,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>why the sweet symphony of Paradise</l>
		<l>is silent in this heaven, while, below,</l>
		<l>it sounds devoutly through the other spheres.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Your hearing is as mortal as your sight;</l>
		<l>thus, here there is no singing,&quot; he replied,</l>
		<l>&quot;and Beatrice, in like wise, did not smile.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When, down the sacred staircase, I descended,</l>
		<l>I only came to welcome you with gladness-</l>
		<l>with words and with the light that mantles me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The love that prompted me is not supreme;</l>
		<l>above, is love that equals or exceeds</l>
		<l>my own, as spirit-flames will let you see.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But the deep charity, which makes us keen</l>
		<l>to serve the Providence that rules the world,</l>
		<l>allots our actions here, as you perceive.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O holy lamp,&quot; I said, &quot;I do indeed</l>
		<l>see how, within this court, it is your free</l>
		<l>love that fulfills eternal Providence;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but this seems difficult for me to grasp:</l>
		<l>why you alone, of those who form these ranks,</l>
		<l>were he who was predestined to this task.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I had yet to reach the final word</l>
		<l>when that light made a pivot of its midpoint</l>
		<l>and spun around as would a swift millstone.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then, from within its light, that love replied:</l>
		<l>&quot;Light from the Deity descends on me;</l>
		<l>it penetrates the light that enwombs me;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>its power, as it joins my power of sight,</l>
		<l>lifts me so far beyond myself that I</l>
		<l>see the High Source from which that light derives.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>From this there comes the joy with which I am</l>
		<l>aflame; I match the clearness of my light</l>
		<l>with equal measure of my clear insight.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But even Heaven&apos;s most enlightened soul,</l>
		<l>that Seraph with his eye most set on God,</l>
		<l>could not provide the why, not satisfy</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>what you have asked; for deep in the abyss</l>
		<l>of the Eternal Ordinance, it is</l>
		<l>cut off from all created beings&apos; vision.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And to the mortal world, when you return,</l>
		<l>tell this, lest men continue to trespass</l>
		<l>and set their steps toward such a reachless goal.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The mind, bright here, on earth is dulled and smok</l>
		<l>Think: how, below, can mind see that which hides</l>
		<l>even when mind is raised to Heaven&apos;s height?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His words so curbed my query that I left</l>
		<l>behind my questioning; and I drew back</l>
		<l>and humbly asked that spirit who he was.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Not far from your homeland, between two shores</l>
		<l>of Italy, the stony ridges rise</l>
		<l>so high that, far below them, thunder roars.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These ridges form a hump called Catria;</l>
		<l>a consecrated hermitage beneath</l>
		<l>that peak was once devoted just to worship.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So his third speech to me began; then he</l>
		<l>continued: &quot;There, within that monastery,</l>
		<l>in serving God, I gained tenacity:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>with food that only olive juice had seasoned,</l>
		<l>I could sustain with ease both heat and frost,</l>
		<l>content within my contemplative thoughts.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That cloister used to offer souls to Heaven,</l>
		<l>a fertile harvest, but it now is barren-</l>
		<l>as Heaven&apos;s punishment will soon make plain.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There I was known as Peter Damian</l>
		<l>and, on the Adriatic shore, was Peter</l>
		<l>the Sinner when I served Our Lady&apos;s House.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Not much of mortal life was left to me</l>
		<l>when I was sought for, dragged to take that hat</l>
		<l>which always passes down from bad to worse.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Once there were Cephas and the Holy Ghost&apos;s</l>
		<l>great vessel: they were barefoot, they were lean,</l>
		<l>they took their food at any inn they found.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But now the modern pastors are so plump</l>
		<l>that they have need of one to prop them up</l>
		<l>on this side, one on that, and one in front,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and one to hoist them saddleward. Their cloaks</l>
		<l>cover their steeds, two beasts beneath one skin:</l>
		<l>o patience, you who must endure so much!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These words, I saw, had summoned many flames,</l>
		<l>descending step by step; I saw them wheel</l>
		<l>and, at each turn, become more beautiful.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>They joined around him, and they stopped, and rais</l>
		<l>a cry so deep that nothing here can be</l>
		<l>its likeness; but the words they cried I could</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>not understand-their thunder overcame me.</l>
	</p>
