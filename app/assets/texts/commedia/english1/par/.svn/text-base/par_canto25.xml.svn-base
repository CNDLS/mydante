		<l>If it should happen . . . If this sacred poem-</l>
		<l>this work so shared by heaven and by earth</l>
		<l>that it has made me lean through these long years-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>can ever overcome the cruelty</l>
		<l>that bars me from the fair fold where I slept,</l>
		<l>a lamb opposed to wolves that war on it,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>by then with other voice, with other fleece,</l>
		<l>I shall return as poet and put on,</l>
		<l>at my baptismal font, the laurel crown;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for there I first found entry to that faith</l>
		<l>which makes souls welcome unto God, and then,</l>
		<l>for that faith, Peter garlanded my brow.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then did a light move toward us from that sphere</l>
		<l>from which emerged the first-the dear, the rare-</l>
		<l>of those whom Christ had left to be His vicars;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and full of happiness, my lady said</l>
		<l>to me: &quot;Look, look-and see the baron whom,</l>
		<l>below on earth, they visit in Galicia.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As when a dove alights near its companion,</l>
		<l>and each unto the other, murmuring</l>
		<l>and circling, offers its affection, so</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>did I see both those great and glorious</l>
		<l>princes give greeting to each other, praising</l>
		<l>the banquet that is offered them on high.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But when their salutations were complete,</l>
		<l>each stopped in silence coram me, and each</l>
		<l>was so aflame, my vision felt defeat.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then Beatrice said, smiling: &quot;Famous life</l>
		<l>by whom the generosity of our</l>
		<l>basilica has been described, do let</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>matters of hope reecho at this height;</l>
		<l>you can-for every time that Jesus favored</l>
		<l>you three above the rest, you were the figure</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of hope.&quot; &quot;Lift up your head, and be assured:</l>
		<l>whatever comes here from the mortal world</l>
		<l>has to be ripened in our radiance.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The second fire offered me this comfort;</l>
		<l>at which my eyes were lifted to the mountains</l>
		<l>whose weight of light before had kept me bent.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Because our Emperor, out of His grace,</l>
		<l>has willed that you, before your death, may face</l>
		<l>His nobles in the inmost of His halls,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so that, when you have seen this court in truth,</l>
		<l>hope-which, below, spurs love of the true good-</l>
		<l>in you and others may be comforted,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>do tell what hope is, tell how it has blossomed</l>
		<l>within your mind, and from what source it came</l>
		<l>to you&quot;-so did the second flame continue.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And she, compassionate, who was the guide</l>
		<l>who led my feathered wings to such high flight,</l>
		<l>did thus anticipate my own reply:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;There is no child of the Church Militant</l>
		<l>who has more hope than he has, as is written</l>
		<l>within the Sun whose rays reach all our ranks:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>thus it is granted him to come from Egypt</l>
		<l>into Jerusalem that he have vision</l>
		<l>of it, before his term of warring ends.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The other two points of your question, which</l>
		<l>were not asked so that you may know, but that</l>
		<l>he may report how much you prize this virtue,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I leave to him; he will not find them hard</l>
		<l>or cause for arrogance; as you have asked,</l>
		<l>let him reply, and God&apos;s grace help his task.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As a disciple answering his master,</l>
		<l>prepared and willing in what he knows well,</l>
		<l>that his proficiency may be revealed,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I said: &quot;Hope is the certain expectation</l>
		<l>of future glory; it is the result</l>
		<l>of God&apos;s grace and of merit we have earned.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This light has come to me from many stars;</l>
		<l>but he who first instilled it in my heart</l>
		<l>was the chief singer of the Sovereign Guide.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&apos;May those&apos;-he says within his theody-</l>
		<l>&apos;who know Your name, put hope in You&apos;; and if</l>
		<l>one has my faith, can he not know God&apos;s name?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And just as he instilled, you then instilled</l>
		<l>with your Epistle, so that I am full</l>
		<l>and rain again your rain on other souls.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>While I was speaking, in the living heart</l>
		<l>of that soul-flame there came a trembling flash,</l>
		<l>sudden, repeated, just as lightning cracks.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then it breathed forth: &quot;The love with which I sti</l>
		<l>burn for the virtue that was mine until</l>
		<l>the palm and my departure from the field,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>would have me breathe again to you who take</l>
		<l>such joy in hope; and I should welcome words</l>
		<l>that tell what hope has promised unto you.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I: &quot;The new and ancient Scriptures set</l>
		<l>the mark for souls whom God befriends; for me,</l>
		<l>that mark means what is promised us by hope.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Isaiah says that all of the elect</l>
		<l>shall wear a double garment in their land:</l>
		<l>and their land is this sweet life of the blessed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And where your brother treats of those white robes</l>
		<l>he has-with words direct and evident-</l>
		<l>made clear to us Isaiah&apos;s revelation.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At first, as soon as I had finished speaking,</l>
		<l>&quot;Sperent in te&quot; was heard above us, all</l>
		<l>the circling garlands answering this call.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then, among those souls, one light became</l>
		<l>so bright that, if the Crab had one such crystal,</l>
		<l>winter would have a month of one long day.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And as a happy maiden rises and</l>
		<l>enters the dance to honor the new bride-</l>
		<l>and not through vanity or other failing-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so did I see that splendor, brightening,</l>
		<l>approach those two flames dancing in a ring</l>
		<l>to music suited to their burning love.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And there it joined the singing and the circling,</l>
		<l>on which my lady kept her eyes intent,</l>
		<l>just like a bride, silent and motionless.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;This soul is he who lay upon the breast</l>
		<l>of Christ our Pelican, and he was asked</l>
		<l>from on the Cross to serve in the great task.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So spoke my lady; but her gaze was not</l>
		<l>to be diverted from its steadfastness,</l>
		<l>not after or before her words were said.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even as he who squints and strains to see</l>
		<l>the sun somewhat eclipsed and, as he tries</l>
		<l>to see, becomes sightless, just so did I</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>in my attempt to watch the latest flame,</l>
		<l>until these words were said: &quot;Why do you daze</l>
		<l>yourself to see what here can have no place?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>On earth my body now is earth and shall</l>
		<l>be there together with the rest until</l>
		<l>our number equals the eternal purpose.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Only those two lights that ascended wear</l>
		<l>their double garment in this blessed cloister.</l>
		<l>And carry this report back to your world.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When he began to speak, the flaming circle</l>
		<l>had stopped its dance; so, too, its song had cease</l>
		<l>that gentle mingling of their threefold breath-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>even as when, avoiding danger or</l>
		<l>simply to rest, the oars that strike the water,</l>
		<l>together halt when rowers hear a whistle.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Ah, how disturbed I was within my mind,</l>
		<l>when I turned round to look at Beatrice,</l>
		<l>on finding that I could not see, though I</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>was close to her, and in the world of gladness!</l>
	</p>
