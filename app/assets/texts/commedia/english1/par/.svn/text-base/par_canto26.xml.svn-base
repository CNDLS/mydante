	<p>
		<l>While I, with blinded eyes, was apprehensive,</l>
		<l>from that bright flame which had consumed my visio</l>
		<l>there breathed a voice that centered my attention,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>saying: &quot;Until you have retrieved the power</l>
		<l>of sight, which you consumed in me, it would</l>
		<l>be best to compensate by colloquy.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then do begin; declare the aim on which</l>
		<l>your soul is set-and be assured of this:</l>
		<l>your vision, though confounded, is not dead,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>because the woman who conducts you through</l>
		<l>this godly region has, within her gaze,</l>
		<l>that force the hand of Ananias had.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I said: &quot;As pleases her, may solace-sooner</l>
		<l>or later-reach these eyes, her gates when she</l>
		<l>brought me the fire with which I always burn.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The good with which this court is satisfied</l>
		<l>is Alpha and Omega of all writings</l>
		<l>that Love has-loud or low-read out to me.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It was the very voice that had dispelled</l>
		<l>the fear I felt at sudden dazzlement,</l>
		<l>that now, with further words, made me concerned</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to speak again. He said: &quot;You certainly</l>
		<l>must sift with a still finer sieve, must tell</l>
		<l>who led your bow to aim at such a target.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I: &quot;By philosophic arguments</l>
		<l>and by authority whose source is here,</l>
		<l>that love must be imprinted in me; for</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the good, once it is understood as such,</l>
		<l>enkindles love; and in accord with more</l>
		<l>goodness comes greater love. And thus the mind</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of anyone who can discern the truth</l>
		<l>on which this proof is founded must be moved</l>
		<l>to love, more than it loves all else, that Essence</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>which is preeminent (since any good</l>
		<l>that lies outside of It is nothing but</l>
		<l>a ray reflected from Its radiance).</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My mind discerns this truth, made plain by him</l>
		<l>who demonstrates to me that the first love</l>
		<l>of the eternal beings is their Maker.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The voice of the true Author states this, too,</l>
		<l>where He tells Moses, speaking of Himself:</l>
		<l>&apos;I shall show you all goodness.&apos; You reveal</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>this, too, when you begin your high Evangel,</l>
		<l>which more than any other proclamation</l>
		<l>cries out to earth the mystery of Heaven.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I heard: &quot;Through human reasoning and through</l>
		<l>authorities according with it, you</l>
		<l>conclude: your highest love is bent on God.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But tell me, too, if you feel other cords</l>
		<l>draw you toward Him, so that you voice aloud</l>
		<l>all of the teeth by which this love grips you.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The holy intent of Christ&apos;s Eagle was</l>
		<l>not hidden; I indeed was made aware</l>
		<l>of what he would most have my words declare.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus I began again: &quot;My charity</l>
		<l>results from all those things whose bite can bring</l>
		<l>the heart to turn to God; the world&apos;s existence</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and mine, the death that He sustained that I</l>
		<l>might live, and that which is the hope of all</l>
		<l>believers, as it is my hope, together</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>with living knowledge I have spoken of-</l>
		<l>these drew me from the sea of twisted love</l>
		<l>and set me on the shore of the right love.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The leaves enleaving all the garden of</l>
		<l>the Everlasting Gardener, I love</l>
		<l>according to the good He gave to them.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As soon as I was still, a song most sweet</l>
		<l>resounded through that heaven, and my lady</l>
		<l>said with the others: &quot;Holy, holy, holy!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And just as a sharp light will startle us</l>
		<l>from sleep because the spirit of eyesight</l>
		<l>races to meet the brightness that proceeds</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>from layer to layer in the eye, and he</l>
		<l>who wakens is confused by what he sees,</l>
		<l>awaking suddenly, and knows no thing</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>until his judgment helps him; even so</l>
		<l>did Beatrice dispel, with her eyes&apos; rays,</l>
		<l>which shone more than a thousand miles, the chaff</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>from my eyes: I saw better than I had</l>
		<l>before; and as if stupefied, I asked</l>
		<l>about the fourth light that I saw among us.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My lady answered: &quot;In those rays there gazes</l>
		<l>with love for his Creator the first soul</l>
		<l>ever created by the Primal Force.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As does a tree that bends its crown because</l>
		<l>of winds that gust, and then springs up, raised by</l>
		<l>its own sustaining power, so did I</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>while she was speaking. I, bewildered, then</l>
		<l>restored to confidence by that desire</l>
		<l>to speak with which I was inflamed, began:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O fruit that was the only one to be</l>
		<l>brought forth already ripe, o ancient father</l>
		<l>to whom each bride is as a daughter and</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>daughter-in-law, devoutly as I can,</l>
		<l>I do beseech you: speak with me. You see</l>
		<l>my wish; to hear you sooner, I do not</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>declare it.&quot; And the primal soul-much as</l>
		<l>an animal beneath a cover stirs,</l>
		<l>so that its feelings are made evident</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when what enfolds it follows all its movements-</l>
		<l>showed me, through that which covered him, with wh</l>
		<l>rejoicing he was coming to delight me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then he breathed forth: &quot;Though you do not declare</l>
		<l>your wish, I can perceive it better than</l>
		<l>you can perceive the things you hold most certain;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for I can see it in the Truthful Mirror</l>
		<l>that perfectly reflects all else, while no</l>
		<l>thing can reflect that Mirror perfectly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You wish to hear how long it is since I</l>
		<l>was placed by God in that high garden where</l>
		<l>this lady readied you to climb a stair</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so long, and just how long it pleased my eyes,</l>
		<l>and the true cause of the great anger, and</l>
		<l>what idiom I used and shaped. My son,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the cause of my long exile did not lie</l>
		<l>within the act of tasting of the tree,</l>
		<l>but solely in my trespass of the boundary.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>During four thousand three hundred and two</l>
		<l>re-turnings of the sun, while I was in</l>
		<l>that place from which your Lady sent you Virgil,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I longed for this assembly. While on earth,</l>
		<l>I saw the sun return to all the lights</l>
		<l>along its way, nine hundred thirty times.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The tongue I spoke was all extinct before</l>
		<l>the men of Nimrod set their minds upon</l>
		<l>the unaccomplishable task; for never</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>has any thing produced by human reason</l>
		<l>been everlasting-following the heavens,</l>
		<l>men seek the new, they shift their predilections.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That man should speak at all is nature&apos;s act,</l>
		<l>but how you speak-in this tongue or in that-</l>
		<l>she leaves to you and to your preference.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Before I was sent down to Hell&apos;s torments,</l>
		<l>on earth, the Highest Good-from which derives</l>
		<l>the joy that now enfolds me-was called I;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and then He was called El. Such change must be:</l>
		<l>the ways that mortals take are as the leaves</l>
		<l>upon a branch-one comes, another goes.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>On that peak rising highest from the sea,</l>
		<l>my life-first pure, then tainted-lasted from</l>
		<l>the first hour to the hour that follows on</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the sixth, when the sun shifts to a new quadrant.</l>
