	<p>
		<l>That sun which first had warmed my breast with lov</l>
		<l>had now revealed to me, confuting, proving,</l>
		<l>the gentle face of truth, its loveliness;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and I, in order to declare myself</l>
		<l>corrected and convinced, lifted my head</l>
		<l>as high as my confessional required.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But a new vision showed itself to me;</l>
		<l>the grip in which it held me was so fast</l>
		<l>that I did not remember to confess.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as, returning through transparent, clean</l>
		<l>glass, or through waters calm and crystalline</l>
		<l>(so shallow that they scarcely can reflect),</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the mirrored image of our faces meets</l>
		<l>our pupils with no greater force than that</l>
		<l>a pearl has when displayed on a white forehead-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so faint, the many faces I saw keen</l>
		<l>to speak; thus, my mistake was contrary</l>
		<l>to that which led the man to love the fountain.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As soon as I had noticed them, thinking</l>
		<l>that what I saw were merely mirrorings,</l>
		<l>I turned around to see who they might be;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and I saw nothing; and I let my sight</l>
		<l>turn back to meet the light of my dear guide,</l>
		<l>who, as she smiled, glowed in her holy eyes.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;There is no need to wonder if I smile,&quot;</l>
		<l>she said, &quot;because you reason like a child;</l>
		<l>your steps do not yet rest upon the truth;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>your mind misguides you into emptiness:</l>
		<l>what you are seeing are true substances,</l>
		<l>placed here because their vows were not fulfilled.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus, speak and listen; trust what they will say:</l>
		<l>the truthful light in which they find their peace</l>
		<l>will not allow their steps to turn astray.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I turned to the shade that seemed most anxiou</l>
		<l>to speak, and I began as would a man</l>
		<l>bewildered by desire too intense:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O spirit born to goodness, you who feel,</l>
		<l>beneath the rays of the eternal life,</l>
		<l>that sweetness which cannot be known unless</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>it is experienced, it would be gracious</l>
		<l>of you to let me know your name and fate.&quot;</l>
		<l>At this, unhesitant, with smiling eyes:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Our charity will never lock its gates</l>
		<l>against just will; our love is like the Love</l>
		<l>that would have all Its court be like Itself.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Within the world I was a nun, a virgin;</l>
		<l>and if your mind attends and recollects,</l>
		<l>my greater beauty here will not conceal me,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and you will recognize me as Piccarda,</l>
		<l>who, placed here with the other blessed ones,</l>
		<l>am blessed within the slowest of the spheres.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Our sentiments, which only serve the flame</l>
		<l>that is the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,</l>
		<l>delight in their conforming to His order.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And we are to be found within a sphere</l>
		<l>this low, because we have neglected vows,</l>
		<l>so that in some respect we were deficient.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I to her: &quot;Within your wonderful</l>
		<l>semblance there is something divine that glows,</l>
		<l>transforming the appearance you once showed:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>therefore, my recognizing you was slow;</l>
		<l>but what you now have told me is of help;</l>
		<l>I can identify you much more clearly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But tell me: though you&apos;re happy here, do you</l>
		<l>desire a higher place in order to</l>
		<l>see more and to be still more close to Him?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Together with her fellow shades she smiled</l>
		<l>at first; then she replied to me with such</l>
		<l>gladness, like one who burns with love&apos;s first fla</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Brother, the power of love appeases our</l>
		<l>will so-we only long for what we have;</l>
		<l>we do not thirst for greater blessedness.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Should we desire a higher sphere than ours,</l>
		<l>then our desires would be discordant with</l>
		<l>the will of Him who has assigned us here,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but you&apos;ll see no such discord in these spheres;</l>
		<l>to live in love is-here-necessity,</l>
		<l>if you think on love&apos;s nature carefully.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The essence of this blessed life consists</l>
		<l>in keeping to the boundaries of God&apos;s will,</l>
		<l>through which our wills become one single will;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so that, as we are ranged from step to step</l>
		<l>throughout this kingdom, all this kingdom wills</l>
		<l>that which will please the King whose will is rule</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And in His will there is our peace: that sea</l>
		<l>to which all beings move-the beings He</l>
		<l>creates or nature makes-such is His will.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then it was clear to me how every place</l>
		<l>in Heaven is in Paradise, though grace</l>
		<l>does not rain equally from the High Good.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But just as, when our hunger has been sated</l>
		<l>with one food, we still long to taste the other-</l>
		<l>while thankful for the first, we crave the latter-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so was I in my words and in my gestures,</l>
		<l>asking to learn from her what was the web</l>
		<l>of which her shuttle had not reached the end.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;A perfect life,&quot; she said, &quot;and her high merit</l>
		<l>enheaven, up above, a woman whose</l>
		<l>rule governs those who, in your world, would wear</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>nuns&apos; dress and veil, so that, until their death,</l>
		<l>they wake and sleep with that Spouse who accepts</l>
		<l>all vows that love conforms unto His pleasure.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Still young, I fled the world to follow her;</l>
		<l>and, in her order&apos;s habit, I enclosed</l>
		<l>myself and promised my life to her rule.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then men more used to malice than to good</l>
		<l>took me-violently-from my sweet cloister:</l>
		<l>God knows what, after that, my life became.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This other radiance that shows itself</l>
		<l>to you at my right hand, a brightness kindled</l>
		<l>by all the light that fills our heaven-she</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>has understood what I have said: she was</l>
		<l>a sister, and from her head, too, by force,</l>
		<l>the shadow of the sacred veil was taken.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But though she had been turned back to the world</l>
		<l>against her will, against all honest practice,</l>
		<l>the veil upon her heart was never loosed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This is the splendor of the great Costanza,</l>
		<l>who from the Swabians&apos; second gust engendered</l>
		<l>the one who was their third and final power.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This said, she then began to sing &quot;Ave</l>
		<l>Maria&quot; and, while singing, vanished as</l>
		<l>a weighty thing will vanish in deep water.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My sight, which followed her as long as it</l>
		<l>was able to, once she was out of view,</l>
		<l>returned to where its greater longing lay,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and it was wholly bent on Beatrice;</l>
		<l>but she then struck my eyes with so much brightnes</l>
		<l>that I, at first, could not withstand her force;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and that made me delay my questioning.</l>
	</p>
