	<p>
		<l>Perhaps six thousand miles away from us,</l>
		<l>the sixth hour burns, and now our world inclines</l>
		<l>its shadow to an almost level bed,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so that the span of heaven high above</l>
		<l>begins to alter so, that some stars are</l>
		<l>no longer to be seen from our deep earth;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and as the brightest handmaid of the sun</l>
		<l>advances, heaven shuts off, one by one,</l>
		<l>its lights, until the loveliest is gone.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So did the triumph that forever plays</l>
		<l>around the Point that overcame me (Point</l>
		<l>that seems enclosed by that which It encloses)</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>fade gradually from my sight, so that</l>
		<l>my seeing nothing else-and love-compelled</l>
		<l>my eyes to turn again to Beatrice.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If that which has been said of her so far</l>
		<l>were all contained within a single praise,</l>
		<l>it would be much too scant to serve me now.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The loveliness I saw surpassed not only</l>
		<l>our human measure-and I think that, surely,</l>
		<l>only its Maker can enjoy it fully.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I yield: I am defeated at this passage</l>
		<l>more than a comic or a tragic poet</l>
		<l>has ever been by a barrier in his theme;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for like the sun that strikes the frailest eyes,</l>
		<l>so does the memory of her sweet smile</l>
		<l>deprive me of the use of my own mind.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>From that first day when, in this life, I saw</l>
		<l>her face, until I had this vision, no</l>
		<l>thing ever cut the sequence of my song,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but now I must desist from this pursuit,</l>
		<l>in verses, of her loveliness, just as</l>
		<l>each artist who has reached his limit must.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So she, in beauty (as I leave her to</l>
		<l>a herald that is greater than my trumpet,</l>
		<l>which nears the end of its hard theme), with voice</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and bearing of a guide whose work is done,</l>
		<l>began again: &quot;From matter&apos;s largest sphere,</l>
		<l>we now have reached the heaven of pure light,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>light of the intellect, light filled with love,</l>
		<l>love of true good, love filled with happiness,</l>
		<l>a happiness surpassing every sweetness.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Here you will see both ranks of Paradise</l>
		<l>and see one of them wearing that same aspect</l>
		<l>which you will see again at Judgment Day.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Like sudden lightning scattering the spirits</l>
		<l>of sight so that the eye is then too weak</l>
		<l>to act on other things it would perceive,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>such was the living light encircling me,</l>
		<l>leaving me so enveloped by its veil</l>
		<l>of radiance that I could see no thing.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;The Love that calms this heaven always welcomes</l>
		<l>into Itself with such a salutation,</l>
		<l>to make the candle ready for its flame.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No sooner had these few words entered me</l>
		<l>than I became aware that I was rising</l>
		<l>beyond the power that was mine; and such</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>new vision kindled me again, that even</l>
		<l>the purest light would not have been so bright</l>
		<l>as to defeat my eyes, deny my sight;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and I saw light that took a river&apos;s form-</l>
		<l>light flashing, reddish-gold, between two banks</l>
		<l>painted with wonderful spring flowerings.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Out of that stream there issued living sparks,</l>
		<l>which settled on the flowers on all sides,</l>
		<l>like rubies set in gold; and then, as if</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>intoxicated with the odors, they</l>
		<l>again plunged into the amazing flood:</l>
		<l>as one spark sank, another spark emerged.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;The high desire that now inflames, incites,</l>
		<l>you to grasp mentally the things you see,</l>
		<l>pleases me more as it swells more; but first,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that you may satisfy your mighty thirst,</l>
		<l>you must drink of these waters.&quot; So did she</l>
		<l>who is the sun of my eyes speak to me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>She added this: &quot;The river and the gems</l>
		<l>of topaz entering and leaving, and</l>
		<l>the grasses&apos; laughter-these are shadowy</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>prefaces of their truth; not that these things</l>
		<l>are lacking in themselves; the defect lies</l>
		<l>in you, whose sight is not yet that sublime.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No infant who awakes long after his</l>
		<l>usual hour would turn his face toward milk</l>
		<l>as quickly as I hurried toward that stream;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to make still finer mirrors of my eyes,</l>
		<l>I bent down toward the waters which flow there</l>
		<l>that we, in them, may find our betterment.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But as my eyelids&apos; eaves drank of that wave,</l>
		<l>it seemed to me that it had changed its shape:</l>
		<l>no longer straight, that flow now formed a round.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then, just as maskers, when they set aside</l>
		<l>the borrowed likenesses in which they hide,</l>
		<l>seem to be other than they were before,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so were the flowers and the sparks transformed,</l>
		<l>changing to such festivity before me</l>
		<l>that I saw-clearly-both of Heaven&apos;s courts.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O radiance of God, through which I saw</l>
		<l>the noble triumph of the true realm, give</l>
		<l>to me the power to speak of what I saw!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Above, on high, there is a light that makes</l>
		<l>apparent the Creator to the creature</l>
		<l>whose only peace lies in his seeing Him.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The shape which that light takes as it expands</l>
		<l>is circular, and its circumference</l>
		<l>would be too great a girdle for the sun.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>All that one sees of it derives from one</l>
		<l>light-ray reflected from the summit of</l>
		<l>the Primum Mobile, which from it draws</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>power and life. And as a hill is mirrored</l>
		<l>in waters at its base, as if to see</l>
		<l>itself-when rich with grass and flowers-graced,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so, in a thousand tiers that towered above</l>
		<l>the light, encircling it, I saw, mirrored,</l>
		<l>all of us who have won return above.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And if the lowest rank ingathers such</l>
		<l>vast light, then what must be the measure of</l>
		<l>this Rose where it has reached its highest leaves!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Within that breadth and height I did not find</l>
		<l>my vision gone astray, for it took in</l>
		<l>that joy in all its quality and kind.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There, near and far do not subtract or add;</l>
		<l>for where God governs with no mediator,</l>
		<l>no thing depends upon the laws of nature.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Into the yellow of the eternal Rose</l>
		<l>that slopes and stretches and diffuses fragrance</l>
		<l>of praise unto the Sun of endless spring,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>now Beatrice drew me as one who, though</l>
		<l>he would speak out, is silent. And she said:</l>
		<l>&quot;See how great is this council of white robes!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>See how much space our city&apos;s circuit spans!</l>
		<l>See how our seated ranks are now so full</l>
		<l>that little room is left for any more!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And in that seat on which your eyes are fixed</l>
		<l>because a crown already waits above it,</l>
		<l>before you join this wedding feast, shall sit</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the soul of noble Henry, he who is,</l>
		<l>on earth, to be imperial; he shall</l>
		<l>show Italy the righteous way-but when</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>she is unready. The blind greediness</l>
		<l>bewitching you, has made you like the child</l>
		<l>who dies of hunger and drives off his nurse.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And in the holy forum such shall be</l>
		<l>the Prefect then, that either openly</l>
		<l>or secretly he will not walk with Henry.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But God will not endure him long within</l>
		<l>the holy ministry: he shall be cast</l>
		<l>down there, where Simon Magus pays; he shall</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>force the Anagnine deeper in his hole.&quot;</l>
