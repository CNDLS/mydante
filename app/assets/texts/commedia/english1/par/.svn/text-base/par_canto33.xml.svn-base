		<l>&quot;Virgin mother, daughter of your Son,</l>
		<l>more humble and sublime than any creature,</l>
		<l>fixed goal decreed from all eternity,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>you are the one who gave to human nature</l>
		<l>so much nobility that its Creator</l>
		<l>did not disdain His being made its creature.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That love whose warmth allowed this flower to bloo</l>
		<l>within the everlasting peace-was love</l>
		<l>rekindled in your womb; for us above,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>you are the noonday torch of charity,</l>
		<l>and there below, on earth, among the mortals,</l>
		<l>you are a living spring of hope. Lady,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>you are so high, you can so intercede,</l>
		<l>that he who would have grace but does not seek</l>
		<l>your aid, may long to fly but has no wings.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Your loving-kindness does not only answer</l>
		<l>the one who asks, but it is often ready</l>
		<l>to answer freely long before the asking.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>In you compassion is, in you is pity,</l>
		<l>in you is generosity, in you</l>
		<l>is every goodness found in any creature.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This man-who from the deepest hollow in</l>
		<l>the universe, up to this height, has seen</l>
		<l>the lives of spirits, one by one-now pleads</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>with you, through grace, to grant him so much virt</l>
		<l>that he may lift his vision higher still-</l>
		<l>may lift it toward the ultimate salvation.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I, who never burned for my own vision</l>
		<l>more than I burn for his, do offer you</l>
		<l>all of my prayers-and pray that they may not</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>fall short-that, with your prayers, you may disper</l>
		<l>all of the clouds of his mortality</l>
		<l>so that the Highest Joy be his to see.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This, too, o Queen, who can do what you would,</l>
		<l>I ask of you: that after such a vision,</l>
		<l>his sentiments preserve their perseverance.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>May your protection curb his mortal passions.</l>
		<l>See Beatrice-how many saints with her!</l>
		<l>They join my prayers! They clasp their hands to yo</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The eyes that are revered and loved by God,</l>
		<l>now fixed upon the supplicant, showed us</l>
		<l>how welcome such devotions are to her;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>then her eyes turned to the Eternal Light-</l>
		<l>there, do not think that any creature&apos;s eye</l>
		<l>can find its way as clearly as her sight.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I, who now was nearing Him who is</l>
		<l>the end of all desires, as I ought,</l>
		<l>lifted my longing to its ardent limit.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Bernard was signaling-he smiled-to me</l>
		<l>to turn my eyes on high; but I, already</l>
		<l>was doing what he wanted me to do,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>because my sight, becoming pure, was able</l>
		<l>to penetrate the ray of Light more deeply-</l>
		<l>that Light, sublime, which in Itself is true.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>From that point on, what I could see was greater</l>
		<l>than speech can show: at such a sight, it fails-</l>
		<l>and memory fails when faced with such excess.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As one who sees within a dream, and, later,</l>
		<l>the passion that had been imprinted stays,</l>
		<l>but nothing of the rest returns to mind,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>such am I, for my vision almost fades</l>
		<l>completely, yet it still distills within</l>
		<l>my heart the sweetness that was born of it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So is the snow, beneath the sun, unsealed;</l>
		<l>and so, on the light leaves, beneath the wind,</l>
		<l>the oracles the Sibyl wrote were lost.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O Highest Light, You, raised so far above</l>
		<l>the minds of mortals, to my memory</l>
		<l>give back something of Your epiphany,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and make my tongue so powerful that I</l>
		<l>may leave to people of the future one</l>
		<l>gleam of the glory that is Yours, for by</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>returning somewhat to my memory</l>
		<l>and echoing awhile within these lines,</l>
		<l>Your victory will be more understood.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The living ray that I endured was so</l>
		<l>acute that I believe I should have gone</l>
		<l>astray had my eyes turned away from it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I can recall that I, because of this,</l>
		<l>was bolder in sustaining it until</l>
		<l>my vision reached the Infinite Goodness.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O grace abounding, through which I presumed</l>
		<l>to set my eyes on the Eternal Light</l>
		<l>so long that I spent all my sight on it!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>In its profundity I saw-ingathered</l>
		<l>and bound by love into one single volume-</l>
		<l>what, in the universe, seems separate, scattered:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>substances, accidents, and dispositions</l>
		<l>as if conjoined-in such a way that what</l>
		<l>I tell is only rudimentary.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I think I saw the universal shape</l>
		<l>which that knot takes; for, speaking this, I feel</l>
		<l>a joy that is more ample. That one moment</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>brings more forgetfulness to me than twenty-</l>
		<l>five centuries have brought to the endeavor</l>
		<l>that startled Neptune with the Argo&apos;s shadow!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So was my mind-completely rapt, intent,</l>
		<l>steadfast, and motionless-gazing; and it</l>
		<l>grew ever more enkindled as it watched.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Whoever sees that Light is soon made such</l>
		<l>that it would be impossible for him</l>
		<l>to set that Light aside for other sight;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>because the good, the object of the will,</l>
		<l>is fully gathered in that Light; outside</l>
		<l>that Light, what there is perfect is defective.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>What little I recall is to be told,</l>
		<l>from this point on, in words more weak than those</l>
		<l>of one whose infant tongue still bathes at the bre</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And not because more than one simple semblance</l>
		<l>was in the Living Light at which I gazed-</l>
		<l>for It is always what It was before-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but through my sight, which as I gazed grew strong</l>
		<l>that sole appearance, even as I altered,</l>
		<l>seemed to be changing. In the deep and bright</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>essence of that exalted Light, three circles</l>
		<l>appeared to me; they had three different colors,</l>
		<l>but all of them were of the same dimension;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>one circle seemed reflected by the second,</l>
		<l>as rainbow is by rainbow, and the third</l>
		<l>seemed fire breathed equally by those two circles.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>How incomplete is speech, how weak, when set</l>
		<l>against my thought! And this, to what I saw.</l>
		<l>is such-to call it little is too much.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Eternal Light, You only dwell within</l>
		<l>Yourself, and only You know You; Self-knowing,</l>
		<l>Self-known, You love and smile upon Yourself!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That circle-which, begotten so, appeared</l>
		<l>in You as light reflected-when my eyes</l>
		<l>had watched it with attention for some time,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>within itself and colored like itself,</l>
		<l>to me seemed painted with our effigy,</l>
		<l>so that my sight was set on it completely.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As the geometer intently seeks</l>
		<l>to square the circle, but he cannot reach,</l>
		<l>through thought on thought, the principle he needs</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so I searched that strange sight: I wished to see</l>
		<l>the way in which our human effigy</l>
		<l>suited the circle and found place in it-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and my own wings were far too weak for that.</l>
		<l>But then my mind was struck by light that flashed</l>
		<l>and, with this light, received what it had asked.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Here force failed my high fantasy; but my</l>
		<l>desire and will were moved already-like</l>
		<l>a wheel revolving uniformly-by</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the Love that moves the sun and the other stars.</l>
