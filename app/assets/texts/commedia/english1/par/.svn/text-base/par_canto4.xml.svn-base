		<l>Before a man bit into one of two</l>
		<l>foods equally removed and tempting, he</l>
		<l>would die of hunger if his choice were free;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so would a lamb stand motionless between</l>
		<l>the cravings of two savage wolves, in fear</l>
		<l>of both; so would a dog between two deer;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>thus, I need neither blame nor praise myself</l>
		<l>when both my doubts compelled me equally:</l>
		<l>what kept me silent was necessity.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I did not speak, but in my face were seen</l>
		<l>longing and questioning, more ardent than</l>
		<l>if spoken words had made them evident.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then Beatrice did just as Daniel did,</l>
		<l>when he appeased Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s anger,</l>
		<l>the rage that made the king unjustly fierce.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>She said: &quot;I see how both desires draw you,</l>
		<l>so that your anxiousness to know is self-</l>
		<l>entangled and cannot express itself.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You reason: &apos;If my will to good persists,</l>
		<l>why should the violence of others cause</l>
		<l>the measure of my merit to be less?&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And you are also led to doubt because</l>
		<l>the doctrine Plato taught would find support</l>
		<l>by souls&apos; appearing to return to the stars.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These are the questions that, within your will,</l>
		<l>press equally for answers; therefore, I</l>
		<l>shall treat the most insidious question first.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Neither the Seraph closest unto God,</l>
		<l>nor Moses, Samuel, nor either John-</l>
		<l>whichever one you will-nor Mary has,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I say, their place in any other heaven</l>
		<l>than that which houses those souls you just saw,</l>
		<l>nor will their blessedness last any longer.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But all those souls grace the Empyrean;</l>
		<l>and each of them has gentle life-though some</l>
		<l>sense the Eternal Spirit more, some less.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>They showed themselves to you here not because</l>
		<l>this is their sphere, but as a sign for you</l>
		<l>that in the Empyrean their place is lowest.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Such signs are suited to your mind, since from</l>
		<l>the senses only can it apprehend</l>
		<l>what then becomes fit for the intellect.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And this is why the Bible condescends</l>
		<l>to human powers, assigning feet and hands</l>
		<l>to God, but meaning something else instead.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And Gabriel and Michael and the angel</l>
		<l>who healed the eyes of Tobit are portrayed</l>
		<l>by Holy Church with human visages.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That which Timaeus said in reasoning</l>
		<l>of souls does not describe what you have seen,</l>
		<l>since it would seem that as he speaks he thinks.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He says the soul returns to that same star</l>
		<l>from which-so he believes-it had been taken</l>
		<l>when nature sent that soul as form to body;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but his opinion is, perhaps, to be</l>
		<l>taken in other guise than his words speak,</l>
		<l>intending something not to be derided.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If to these spheres he wanted to attribute</l>
		<l>honor and blame for what they influence,</l>
		<l>perhaps his arrow reaches something true.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This principle, ill-understood, misled</l>
		<l>almost all of the world once, so that Jove</l>
		<l>and Mercury and Mars gave names to stars.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The other doubt that agitates you is</l>
		<l>less poisonous; for its insidiousness</l>
		<l>is not such as to lead you far from me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>To mortal eyes our justice seems unjust;</l>
		<l>that this is so, should serve as evidence</l>
		<l>for faith-not heresy&apos;s depravity.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But that your intellect may penetrate</l>
		<l>more carefully into your other query,</l>
		<l>I shall-as you desire-explain it clearly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If violence means that the one who suffers</l>
		<l>has not abetted force in any way,</l>
		<l>then there is no excuse these souls can claim:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for will, if it resists, is never spent,</l>
		<l>but acts as nature acts when fire ascends,</l>
		<l>though force-a thousand times-tries to compel.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So that, when will has yielded much or little,</l>
		<l>it has abetted force-as these souls did:</l>
		<l>they could have fled back to their holy shelter.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Had their will been as whole as that which held</l>
		<l>Lawrence fast to the grate and that which made</l>
		<l>of Mucius one who judged his own hand, then</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>once freed, they would have willed to find the fai</l>
		<l>from which they had been dragged; but it is all</l>
		<l>too seldom that a will is so intact.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And through these words, if you have grasped their</l>
		<l>you can eliminate the argument</l>
		<l>that would have troubled you again-and often.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But now another obstacle obstructs</l>
		<l>your sight; you cannot overcome it by</l>
		<l>yourself-it is too wearying to try.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I&apos;ve set it in your mind as something certain</l>
		<l>that souls in blessedness can never lie,</l>
		<l>since they are always near the Primal Truth.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But from Piccarda you were also able</l>
		<l>to hear how Constance kept her love of the veil:</l>
		<l>and here Piccarda seems to contradict me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Before this-brother-it has often happened</l>
		<l>that, to flee menace, men unwillingly</l>
		<l>did what should not be done; so did Alcmaeon,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to meet the wishes of his father, kill</l>
		<l>his mother-not to fail in filial</l>
		<l>piety, he acted ruthlessly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At that point-I would have you see-the forcea</l>
		<l>to which one yielded mingles with one&apos;s will;</l>
		<l>and no excuse can pardon their joint act.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Absolute will does not concur in wrong;</l>
		<l>but the contingent will, through fear that its</l>
		<l>resistance might bring greater harm, consents.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Therefore, Piccarda means the absolute</l>
		<l>will when she speaks, and I the relative;</l>
		<l>so that the two of us have spoken truth.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Such was the rippling of the holy stream</l>
		<l>issuing from the fountain from which springs</l>
		<l>all truth: it set to rest both of my longings.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I said: &quot;O beloved of the First</l>
		<l>Lover, o you-divine-whose speech so floods</l>
		<l>and warms me that I feel more and more life,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>however deep my gratefulness, it can</l>
		<l>not match your grace with grace enough; but He</l>
		<l>who sees and can-may He grant recompense.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I now see well: we cannot satisfy</l>
		<l>our mind unless it is enlightened by</l>
		<l>the truth beyond whose boundary no truth lies.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Mind, reaching that truth, rests within it as</l>
		<l>a beast within its lair; mind can attain</l>
		<l>that truth-if not, all our desires were vain.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Therefore, our doubting blossoms like a shoot</l>
		<l>out from the root of truth; this natural</l>
		<l>urge spurs us toward the peak, from height to heig</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Lady, my knowing why we doubt, invites,</l>
		<l>sustains, my reverent asking you about</l>
		<l>another truth that is obscure to me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I want to know if, in your eyes, one can</l>
		<l>amend for unkept vows with other acts-</l>
		<l>good works your balance will not find too scant.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then Beatrice looked at me with eyes so full</l>
		<l>of sparks of love, eyes so divine that my</l>
		<l>own force of sight was overcome, took flight,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and, eyes downcast, I almost lost my senses.</l>
	</p>
