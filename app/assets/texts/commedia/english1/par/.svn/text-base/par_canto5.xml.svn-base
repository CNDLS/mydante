	<p>
		<l>&quot;If in the fire of love I seem to flame</l>
		<l>beyond the measure visible on earth,</l>
		<l>so that I overcome your vision&apos;s force,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>you need not wonder; I am so because</l>
		<l>of my perfected vision-as I grasp</l>
		<l>the good, so I approach the good in act.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Indeed I see that in your intellect</l>
		<l>now shines the never-ending light; once seen,</l>
		<l>that light, alone and always, kindles love;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and if a lesser thing allure your love,</l>
		<l>it is a vestige of that light which-though</l>
		<l>imperfectly-gleams through that lesser thing.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You wish to know if, through a righteous act,</l>
		<l>one can repair a promise unfulfilled,</l>
		<l>so that the soul and God are reconciled.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So Beatrice began this canto, and</l>
		<l>as one who does not interrupt her speech,</l>
		<l>so did her holy reasoning proceed:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;The greatest gift the magnanimity</l>
		<l>of God, as He created, gave, the gift</l>
		<l>most suited to His goodness, gift that He</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>most prizes, was the freedom of the will;</l>
		<l>those beings that have intellect-all these</l>
		<l>and none but these-received and do receive</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>this gift: thus you may draw, as consequence,</l>
		<l>the high worth of a vow, when what is pledged</l>
		<l>with your consent encounters God&apos;s consent;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for when a pact is drawn between a man</l>
		<l>and God, then through free will, a man gives up</l>
		<l>what I have called his treasure, his free will.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>What, then, can be a fitting compensation?</l>
		<l>To use again what you had offered, would</l>
		<l>mean seeking to do good with ill-got gains.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>By now you understand the major point;</l>
		<l>but since the Holy Church gives dispensations-</l>
		<l>which seems in contrast with the truth I stated-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>you need to sit at table somewhat longer:</l>
		<l>the food that you have taken was tough food-</l>
		<l>it still needs help, if you are to digest it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Open your mind to what I shall disclose,</l>
		<l>and hold it fast within you; he who hears,</l>
		<l>but does not hold what he has heard, learns nothin</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Two things are of the essence when one vows</l>
		<l>a sacrifice: the matter of the pledge</l>
		<l>and then the formal compact one accepts.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This last can never be annulled until</l>
		<l>the compact is fulfilled: it is of this</l>
		<l>that I have spoken to you so precisely.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Therefore, the Hebrews found it necessary</l>
		<l>to bring their offerings, although-as you</l>
		<l>must know-some of their offerings might be altered</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As for the matter of the vow-discussed</l>
		<l>above-it may be such that if one shifts</l>
		<l>to other matter, one commits no sin.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But let none shift the burden on his shoulder</l>
		<l>through his own judgment, without waiting for</l>
		<l>the turning of the white and yellow keys;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and let him see that any change is senseless,</l>
		<l>unless the thing one sets aside can be</l>
		<l>contained in one&apos;s new weight, as four in six.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus, when the matter of a vow has so</l>
		<l>much weight and worth that it tips every scale,</l>
		<l>no other weight can serve as substitute.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Let mortals never take a vow in jest;</l>
		<l>be faithful and yet circumspect, not rash</l>
		<l>as Jephthah was, in offering his first gift;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he should have said, &apos;I did amiss,&apos; and not</l>
		<l>done worse by keeping faith. And you can find</l>
		<l>that same stupidity in the Greeks&apos; chief-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when her fair face made Iphigenia grieve</l>
		<l>and made the wise and made the foolish weep</l>
		<l>for her when they heard tell of such a rite.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Christians, proceed with greater gravity:</l>
		<l>do not be like a feather at each wind,</l>
		<l>nor think that all immersions wash you clean.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You have both Testaments, the Old and New,</l>
		<l>you have the shepherd of the Church to guide you;</l>
		<l>you need no more than this for your salvation.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If evil greed would summon you elsewhere,</l>
		<l>be men, and not like sheep gone mad, so that</l>
		<l>the Jew who lives among you not deride you!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Do not act like the foolish, wanton lamb</l>
		<l>that leaves its mother&apos;s milk and, heedless, wants</l>
		<l>to war against-and harm-its very self!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These words of Beatrice I here transcribe;</l>
		<l>and then she turned-her longing at the full-</l>
		<l>to where the world is more alive with light.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Her silence and the change in her appearance</l>
		<l>imposed a silence on my avid mind,</l>
		<l>which now was ready to address new questions;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and even as an arrow that has struck</l>
		<l>the mark before the bow-cord comes to rest,</l>
		<l>so did we race to reach the second realm.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When she had passed into that heaven&apos;s light,</l>
		<l>I saw my lady filled with so much gladness</l>
		<l>that, at her joy, the planet grew more bright.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And if the planet changed and smiled, what then</l>
		<l>did I-who by my very nature am</l>
		<l>given to every sort of change-become?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As in a fish-pool that is calm and clear,</l>
		<l>the fish draw close to anything that nears</l>
		<l>from outside, if it seems to be their fare,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>such were the far more than a thousand splendors</l>
		<l>I saw approaching us, and each declared:</l>
		<l>&quot;Here now is one who will increase our loves.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And even as each shade approached, one saw,</l>
		<l>because of the bright radiance it sent forth,</l>
		<l>the joyousness with which that shade was filled.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Consider, reader, what your misery</l>
		<l>and need to know still more would be if, at</l>
		<l>this point, what I began did not go on;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and you will-unassisted-feel how I</l>
		<l>longed so to hear those shades narrate their state</l>
		<l>as soon as they appeared before my eyes.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O you born unto gladness, whom God&apos;s grace</l>
		<l>allows to see the thrones of the eternal</l>
		<l>triumph before your war of life is ended,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the light that kindles us is that same light</l>
		<l>which spreads through all of heaven; thus, if you</l>
		<l>would know us, sate yourself as you may please.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So did one of those pious spirits speak</l>
		<l>to me. And Beatrice then urged: &quot;Speak, speak</l>
		<l>confidently; trust them as you trust gods.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;I see-plainly-how you have nested in</l>
		<l>your own light; see-you draw it from your eyes-</l>
		<l>because it glistens even as you smile;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but I do not know who you are or why,</l>
		<l>good soul, your rank is in a sphere concealed</l>
		<l>from mortals by another planet&apos;s rays.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I said this as I stood turned toward the light</l>
		<l>that first addressed me; and at this, it glowed</l>
		<l>more radiantly than it had before.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as the sun, when heat has worn away</l>
		<l>thick mists that moderate its rays, conceals</l>
		<l>itself from sight through an excess of light,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so did that holy form, through excess gladness,</l>
		<l>conceal himself from me within his rays;</l>
		<l>and so concealed, concealed, he answered me</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>even as the next canto is to sing.</l>
	</p>
