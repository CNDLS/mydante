		<l>&quot;Hosanna, sanctus Deus sabaoth,</l>
		<l>superillustrans claritate tua</l>
		<l>felices ignes horum malacoth!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus, even as he wheeled to his own music,</l>
		<l>I saw that substance sing, that spirit-flame</l>
		<l>above whom double lights were twinned; and he</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and his companions moved within their dance,</l>
		<l>and as if they were swiftest sparks, they sped</l>
		<l>out of my sight because of sudden distance.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I was perplexed, and to myself, I said:</l>
		<l>&quot;Tell her! Tell her! Tell her, the lady who</l>
		<l>can slake my thirst with her sweet drops&quot;; and yet</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the reverence that possesses all of me,</l>
		<l>even on hearing only Be and ice,</l>
		<l>had bowed my head-I seemed a man asleep.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But Beatrice soon ended that; for she</l>
		<l>began to smile at me so brightly that,</l>
		<l>even in fire, a man would still feel glad.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;According to my never-erring judgment,</l>
		<l>the question that perplexes you is how</l>
		<l>just vengeance can deserve just punishment;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but I shall quickly free your mind from doubt;</l>
		<l>and listen carefully; the words I speak</l>
		<l>will bring the gift of a great truth in reach.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Since he could not endure the helpful curb</l>
		<l>on his willpower, the man who was not born,</l>
		<l>damning himself, damned all his progeny.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For this, mankind lay sick, in the abyss</l>
		<l>of a great error, for long centuries,</l>
		<l>until the Word of God willed to descend</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to where the nature that was sundered from</l>
		<l>its Maker was united to His person</l>
		<l>by the sole act of His eternal Love.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now set your sight on what derives from that.</l>
		<l>This nature, thus united to its Maker,</l>
		<l>was good and pure, even as when created;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but in itself, this nature had been banished</l>
		<l>from paradise, because it turned aside</l>
		<l>from its own path, from truth, from its own life.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus, if the penalty the Cross inflicted</l>
		<l>is measured by the nature He assumed,</l>
		<l>no one has ever been so justly stung;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>yet none was ever done so great a wrong,</l>
		<l>if we regard the Person made to suffer,</l>
		<l>He who had gathered in Himself that nature.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus, from one action, issued differing things:</l>
		<l>God and the Jews were pleased by one same death;</l>
		<l>earth trembled for that death and Heaven opened.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You need no longer find it difficult</l>
		<l>to understand when it is said that just</l>
		<l>vengeance was then avenged by a just court.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But I now see your understanding tangled</l>
		<l>by thought on thought into a knot, from which,</l>
		<l>with much desire, your mind awaits release.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You say: &apos;What I have heard is clear to me;</l>
		<l>but this is hidden from me-why God willed</l>
		<l>precisely this pathway for our redemption.&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Brother, this ordinance is buried from</l>
		<l>the eyes of everyone whose intellect</l>
		<l>has not matured within the flame of love.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Nevertheless, since there is much attempting</l>
		<l>to find this point, but little understanding,</l>
		<l>I shall tell why that way was the most fitting.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The Godly Goodness that has banished every</l>
		<l>envy from Its own Self, burns in Itself;</l>
		<l>and sparkling so, It shows eternal beauties.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>All that derives directly from this Goodness</l>
		<l>is everlasting, since the seal of Goodness</l>
		<l>impresses an imprint that never alters.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Whatever rains from It immediately</l>
		<l>is fully free, for it is not constrained</l>
		<l>by any influence of other things.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even as it conforms to that Goodness,</l>
		<l>so does it please It more; the Sacred Ardor</l>
		<l>that gleams in all things is most bright within</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>those things most like Itself. The human being</l>
		<l>has all these gifts, but if it loses one,</l>
		<l>then its nobility has been undone.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Only man&apos;s sin annuls man&apos;s liberty,</l>
		<l>makes him unlike the Highest Good, so that,</l>
		<l>in him, the brightness of Its light is dimmed;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and man cannot regain his dignity</l>
		<l>unless, where sin left emptiness, man fills</l>
		<l>that void with just amends for evil pleasure.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For when your nature sinned so totally</l>
		<l>within its seed, then, from these dignities,</l>
		<l>just as from Paradise, that nature parted;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and they could never be regained-if you</l>
		<l>consider carefully-by any way</l>
		<l>that did not pass across one of these fords:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>either through nothing other than His mercy,</l>
		<l>God had to pardon man, or of himself</l>
		<l>man had to proffer payment for his folly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now fix your eyes on the profundity</l>
		<l>of the Eternal Counsel; heed as closely</l>
		<l>as you are able to, my reasoning.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Man, in his limits, could not recompense;</l>
		<l>for no obedience, no humility,</l>
		<l>he offered later could have been so deep</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that it could match the heights he meant to reach</l>
		<l>through disobedience; man lacked the power</l>
		<l>to offer satisfaction by himself.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus there was need for God, through His own ways,</l>
		<l>to bring man back to life intact-I mean</l>
		<l>by one way or by both. But since a deed</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>pleases its doer more, the more it shows</l>
		<l>the goodness of the heart from which it springs,</l>
		<l>the Godly Goodness that imprints the world</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>was happy to proceed through both Its ways</l>
		<l>to raise you up again. Nor has there been,</l>
		<l>nor will there be, between the final night</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and the first day, a chain of actions so</l>
		<l>lofty and so magnificent as He</l>
		<l>enacted when He followed His two ways;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for God showed greater generosity</l>
		<l>in giving His own self that man might be</l>
		<l>able to rise, than if He simply pardoned;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for every other means fell short of justice,</l>
		<l>except the way whereby the Son of God</l>
		<l>humbled Himself when He became incarnate.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now to give all your wishes full content,</l>
		<l>I go back to explain one point, so that</l>
		<l>you, too, may see it plainly, as I do.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You say: &apos;I see that water, see that fire</l>
		<l>and air and earth and all that they compose</l>
		<l>come to corruption, and endure so briefly;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and yet these, too, were things created; if</l>
		<l>what has been said above is true, then these</l>
		<l>things never should be subject to corruption.&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Brother, the angels and the pure country</l>
		<l>where you are now-these may be said to be</l>
		<l>created, as they are, in all their being;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>whereas the elements that you have mentioned,</l>
		<l>as well as those things that are made from them,</l>
		<l>receive their form from a created power.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The matter they contain had been created,</l>
		<l>just as within the stars that wheel about them,</l>
		<l>the power to give form had been created.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The rays and motion of the holy lights</l>
		<l>draw forth the soul of every animal</l>
		<l>and plant from matter able to take form;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but your life is breathed forth immediately</l>
		<l>by the Chief Good, who so enamors it</l>
		<l>of His own Self that it desires Him always.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So reasoning, you also can deduce</l>
		<l>your resurrection; you need but remember</l>
		<l>the way in which your human flesh was fashioned</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when both of the first parents were created.&quot;</l>
