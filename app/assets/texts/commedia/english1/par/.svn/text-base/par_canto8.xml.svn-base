		<l>The world, when still in peril, thought that, whee</l>
		<l>in the third epicycle, Cyprian</l>
		<l>the fair sent down her rays of frenzied love,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so that, in ancient error, ancient peoples</l>
		<l>not only honored her with sacrifices</l>
		<l>and votive cries, but honored, too, Dione</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and Cupid, one as mother, one as son</l>
		<l>of Cyprian, and told how Cupid sat</l>
		<l>in Dido&apos;s lap; and gave the name of her</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>with whom I have begun this canto, to</l>
		<l>the planet that is courted by the sun,</l>
		<l>at times behind her and at times in front.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I did not notice my ascent to it,</l>
		<l>yet I was sure I was in Venus when</l>
		<l>I saw my lady grow more beautiful.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And just as, in a flame, a spark is seen,</l>
		<l>and as, in plainsong, voice in voice is heard</l>
		<l>one holds the note, the other comes and goes</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw in that light other wheeling lamps,</l>
		<l>some more and some less swift, yet in accord,</l>
		<l>I think, with what their inner vision was.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Winds, seen or unseen, never have descended</l>
		<l>so swiftly from cold clouds as not to seem</l>
		<l>impeded, slow, to any who had seen</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>those godly lights approaching us, halting</l>
		<l>the circling dance those spirits had begun</l>
		<l>within the heaven of high Seraphim;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and a &quot;Hosanna&quot; sounded from within</l>
		<l>their front rankssuch that I have never been</l>
		<l>without desire to hear it sound again.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then one drew nearer us, and he began</l>
		<l>alone: &quot;We all are ready at your pleasure,</l>
		<l>so that you may receive delight from us.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>One circle and one circling and one thirst</l>
		<l>are ours as we revolve with the celestial</l>
		<l>Princes whom, from the world, you once invoked:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&apos;You who, through understanding, move the third</l>
		<l>heaven.&apos; Our love is so completeto bring</l>
		<l>you joy, brief respite will not be less sweet.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>After my eyes had turned with reverence</l>
		<l>to see my lady, after her consent</l>
		<l>had brought them reassurance and content,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>they turned back to the light that promised me</l>
		<l>so much; and, &quot;Tell me, who are you,&quot; I asked</l>
		<l>in a voice stamped with loving sentiment.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And how much larger, brighter did I see</l>
		<l>that spirit grow when, as I spoke, it felt</l>
		<l>new gladness added to its gladnesses!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus changed, it then replied: &quot;The world held me</l>
		<l>briefly below; but had my stay been longer,</l>
		<l>much evil that will be, would not have been.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My happiness, surrounding me with rays,</l>
		<l>keeps me concealed from you; it hides me like</l>
		<l>a creature that is swathed in its own silk.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You loved me much and had good cause for that;</l>
		<l>for had I stayed below, I should have showed</l>
		<l>you more of my love than the leaves alone.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The left bank that the Rhone bathes after it</l>
		<l>has mingled with the waters of the Sorgue,</l>
		<l>awaited me in due time as its lord,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>as did Ausonia&apos;s horn, whichsouth of where</l>
		<l>the Tronto and the Verde reach the sea</l>
		<l>Catona, Bari, and Gaeta border.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Upon my brow a crown already shone</l>
		<l>the crown of that land where the Danube flows</l>
		<l>when it has left behind its German shores.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And fair Trinacria, whom ashes (these</l>
		<l>result from surging sulphur, not Typhoeus)</l>
		<l>cover between Pachynus and Pelorus,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>along the gulf that Eurus vexes most,</l>
		<l>would still await its rulers bornthrough me</l>
		<l>from Charles and Rudolph, if ill sovereignty,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>which always hurts the heart of subject peoples,</l>
		<l>had not provoked Palermo to cry out:</l>
		<l>&apos;Die! Die!&apos; And if my brother could foresee</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>what ill-rule brings, he would already flee</l>
		<l>from Catalonia&apos;s grasping poverty,</l>
		<l>aware that it may cause him injury;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for truly there is need for either him</l>
		<l>or others to prevent his loaded boat</l>
		<l>from having to take on still greater loads.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His niggard nature is descended from</l>
		<l>one who was generous; and he needs soldiers</l>
		<l>who are not bent on filling up their coffers.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;My lord, since I believe that you perceive</l>
		<l>completely where all good begins and ends</l>
		<l>the joy I see within myself on hearing</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>your words to me, my joy is felt more freely;</l>
		<l>and I joy, too, in knowing you are blessed,</l>
		<l>since you perceived this as you gazed at God.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You made me glad; so may you clear the doubt</l>
		<l>that rose in me when you before described</l>
		<l>how from a gentle seed, harsh fruit derives.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These were my words to him, and he replied:</l>
		<l>&quot;If I can show one certain truth to you,</l>
		<l>you will confront what now is at your back.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The Good that moves and makes content the realm</l>
		<l>through which you now ascend, makes providence</l>
		<l>act as a force in these great heavens&apos; bodies;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and in the Mind that, in itself, is perfect,</l>
		<l>not only are the natures of His creatures</l>
		<l>but their well-being, too, provided for;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and thus, whatever this bow shoots must fall</l>
		<l>according to a providential end,</l>
		<l>just like a shaft directed to its target.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Were this not so, the heavens you traverse</l>
		<l>would bring about effects in such a way</l>
		<l>that they would not be things of art but shards.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That cannot be unless the Minds that move</l>
		<l>these planets are defective and, defective,</l>
		<l>the First Mind, which had failed to make them perf</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Would you have this truth still more clear to you?</l>
		<l>I: &quot;No. I see it is impossible</l>
		<l>for nature to fall short of what is needed.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He added: &quot;Tell me, would a man on earth</l>
		<l>be worse if he were not a citizen?&quot;</l>
		<l>&quot;Yes,&quot; I replied, &quot;and here I need no proof.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Can there be citizens if men below</l>
		<l>are not diverse, with diverse duties? No,</l>
		<l>if what your master writes is accurate.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Until this point that shade went on, deducing;</l>
		<l>then he concluded: &quot;Thus, the roots from which</l>
		<l>your tasks proceed must needs be different:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so, one is born a Solon, one a Xerxes,</l>
		<l>and one a Melchizedek, and another,</l>
		<l>he who flew through the air and lost his son.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Revolving nature, serving as a seal</l>
		<l>for mortal wax, plies well its art, but it</l>
		<l>does not distinguish one house from another.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus, even from the seed, Esau takes leave</l>
		<l>of Jacob; and because he had a father</l>
		<l>so base, they said Quirinus was Mars&apos; son.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Engendered natures would forever take</l>
		<l>the path of those who had engendered them,</l>
		<l>did not Divine provision intervene.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now that which stood behind you, stands in front:</l>
		<l>but so that you may know the joy you give me,</l>
		<l>I now would cloak you with a corollary.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Where Nature comes upon discrepant fortune,</l>
		<l>like any seed outside its proper region,</l>
		<l>Nature will always yield results awry.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But if the world below would set its mind</l>
		<l>on the foundation Nature lays as base</l>
		<l>to follow, it would have its people worthy.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But you twist to religion one whose birth</l>
		<l>made him more fit to gird a sword, and make</l>
		<l>a king of one more fit for sermoning,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so that the track you take is off the road.&quot;</l>
