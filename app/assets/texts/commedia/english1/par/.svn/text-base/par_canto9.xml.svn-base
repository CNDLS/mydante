		<l>Fair Clemence, after I had been enlightened</l>
		<l>by your dear Charles, he told me how his seed</l>
		<l>would be defrauded, but he said: &quot;Be silent</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and let the years revolve.&quot; All I can say</l>
		<l>is this: lament for vengeance well-deserved</l>
		<l>will follow on the wrongs you are to suffer.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And now the life-soul of that holy light</l>
		<l>turned to the Sun that fills it even as</l>
		<l>the Goodness that suffices for all things.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Ah, souls seduced and creatures without reverence,</l>
		<l>who twist your hearts away from such a Good,</l>
		<l>who let your brows be bent on emptiness!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And here another of those splendors moved</l>
		<l>toward me; and by its brightening without,</l>
		<l>it showed its wish to please me. Beatrice,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>whose eyes were fixed on me, as they had been</l>
		<l>before, gave me the precious certainty</l>
		<l>that she consented to my need to speak.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Pray, blessed spirit, may you remedy</l>
		<l>quickly my wish to know,&quot; I said. &quot;Give me</l>
		<l>proof that you can reflect the thoughts I think.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At which that light, one still unknown to me,</l>
		<l>out of the depth from which it sang before,</l>
		<l>continued as if it rejoiced in kindness:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;In that part of indecent Italy</l>
		<l>that lies between Rialto and the springs</l>
		<l>from which the Brenta and the Piave stream,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>rises a hill of no great heightfrom which</l>
		<l>a firebrand descended, and it brought</l>
		<l>much injury to all the land about.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Both he and I were born of one same root:</l>
		<l>Cunizza was my name, and I shine here</l>
		<l>because this planet&apos;s radiance conquered me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But in myself I pardon happily</l>
		<l>the reason for my fate; I do not grieve</l>
		<l>and vulgar minds may find this hard to see.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Of the resplendent, precious jewel that stands</l>
		<l>most close to me within-our heaven, much</l>
		<l>fame still remains and will not die away</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>before this hundredth year returns five times:</l>
		<l>see then if man should not seek excellence</l>
		<l>that his first life bequeath another life.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And this, the rabble that is now enclosed</l>
		<l>between the Adige and Tagliamento</l>
		<l>does not consider, nor does it repent</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>despite its scourgings; and since it would shun</l>
		<l>its duty, at the marsh the Paduans</l>
		<l>will stain the river-course that bathes Vicenza;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and where the Sile and Cagnano flow</l>
		<l>in company, one lords it, arrogant;</l>
		<l>the net to catch him is already set.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Feltre shall yet lament the treachery</l>
		<l>of her indecent shepherdact so filthy</l>
		<l>that for the like none ever entered prison.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>would be too large indeed, and weary he</l>
		<l>who weighs it ounce by ounce the vat that he,</l>
		<l>The vat to hold the blood of the Ferrarese</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>generous priest, will offer up to show</l>
		<l>fidelity to his Guelph party; and</l>
		<l>such gifts will suit the customs of that land.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Above are mirrors Thrones is what you call them</l>
		<l>and from them God in judgment shines on us;</l>
		<l>and thus we think it right to say such things.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Here she was silent and appeared to me</l>
		<l>to turn toward other things, reentering</l>
		<l>the wheeling dance where she had been before.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The other joy, already known to me</l>
		<l>as precious, then appeared before my eyes</l>
		<l>like a pure ruby struck by the sun&apos;s rays.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>On high, joy is made manifest by brightness,</l>
		<l>as, here on earth, by smiles; but down below,</l>
		<l>the shade grows darker when the mind feels sorrow.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;God can see all,&quot; I said, &quot;and, blessed spirit,</l>
		<l>your vision is contained in Him, so that</l>
		<l>no wish can ever hide itself from you.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Your voice has always made the heavens glad</l>
		<l>as has the singing of the pious fires</l>
		<l>that make themselves a cowl of their six wings:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>why then do you not satisfy my longings?</l>
		<l>I would not have to wait for your request</l>
		<l>if I could enter you as you do me.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;The widest valley into which the waters</l>
		<l>spread from the sea that girds the world,&quot; his wor</l>
		<l>began, &quot;between discrepant shores, extends</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>eastward so far against the sun, that when</l>
		<l>those waters end at the meridian,</l>
		<l>that point when they began was the horizon.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I lived along the shoreline of that valley</l>
		<l>between the Ebro and the Magra, whose</l>
		<l>brief course divides the Genoese and Tuscans.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Beneath the same sunset, the same sunrise,</l>
		<l>lie both Bougie and my own city, which</l>
		<l>once warmed its harbor with its very blood.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Those men to whom my name was known, called me</l>
		<l>Folco; and even as this sphere receives</l>
		<l>my imprint, so was I impressed with its;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for even Belus&apos; daughter, wronging both</l>
		<l>Sychaeus and Creusa, did not burn</l>
		<l>more than I did, as long as I was young;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>nor did the Rhodopean woman whom</l>
		<l>Demophoon deceived, nor did Alcides</l>
		<l>when he enclosed Iole in his heart.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Yet one does not repent here; here one smiles</l>
		<l>not for the fault, which we do not recall,</l>
		<l>but for the Power that fashioned and foresaw.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For here we contemplate the art adorned</l>
		<l>by such great love, and we discern the good</l>
		<l>through which the world above forms that below.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But so that all your longings born within</l>
		<l>this sphere may be completely satisfied</l>
		<l>when you bear them away, I must continue.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You wish to know what spirit is within</l>
		<l>the light that here beside me sparkles ,so,</l>
		<l>as would a ray of sun in limpid water.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Know then that Rahab lives serenely in</l>
		<l>that light, and since her presence joins our order</l>
		<l>she seals that order in the highest rank.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This heaven, where the shadow cast by earth</l>
		<l>comes to a point, had Rahab as the first</l>
		<l>soul to be taken up when Christ triumphed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And it was right to leave her in this heaven</l>
		<l>as trophy of the lofty victory</l>
		<l>that Christ won, palm on palm, upon the cross,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for she had favored the initial glory</l>
		<l>of Joshua within the Holy Land</l>
		<l>which seldom touches the Pope&apos;s memory.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Your city, which was planted by that one</l>
		<l>who was the first to turn against his Maker,</l>
		<l>the one whose envy cost us many tears</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>produces and distributes the damned flower</l>
		<l>that turns both sheep and lambs from the true cour</l>
		<l>for of the shepherd it has made a wolf.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For this the Gospel and the great Church Fathers</l>
		<l>are set aside and only the Decretals</l>
		<l>are studied as their margins clearly show.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>On these the pope and cardinals are intent.</l>
		<l>Their thoughts are never bent on Nazareth,</l>
		<l>where Gabriel&apos;s open wings were reverent.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And yet the hill of Vatican as well</l>
		<l>as other noble parts of Rome that were</l>
		<l>the cemetery for Peter&apos;s soldiery</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>will soon be freed from priests&apos; adultery.&quot;</l>
