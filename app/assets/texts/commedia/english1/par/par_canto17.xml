		<l>Like Phaethon (one who still makes fathers wary</l>
		<l>of sons) when he had heard insinuations,</l>
		<l>and he, to be assured, came to Clymene,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>such was I and such was I seen to be</l>
		<l>by Beatrice and by the holy lamp</l>
		<l>that-earlier-had shifted place for me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Therefore my lady said to me: &quot;Display</l>
		<l>the flame of your desire, that it may</l>
		<l>be seen well-stamped with your internal seal,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>not that we need to know what you&apos;d reveal,</l>
		<l>but that you learn the way that would disclose</l>
		<l>your thirst, and you be quenched by what we pour.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O my dear root, who, since you rise so high,</l>
		<l>can see the Point in which all times are present-</l>
		<l>for just as earthly minds are able to</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>see that two obtuse angles cannot be</l>
		<l>contained in a triangle, you can see</l>
		<l>contingent things before they come to be-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>while I was in the company of Virgil,</l>
		<l>both on the mountain that heals souls and when</l>
		<l>descending to the dead world, what I heard</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>about my future life were grievous words-</l>
		<l>although, against the blows of chance I feel</l>
		<l>myself as firmly planted as a cube.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus my desire would be appeased if I</l>
		<l>might know what fortune is approaching me:</l>
		<l>the arrow one foresees arrives more gently.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So did I speak to the same living light</l>
		<l>that spoke to me before; as Beatrice</l>
		<l>had wished, what was my wish was now confessed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Not with the maze of words that used to snare</l>
		<l>the fools upon this earth before the Lamb</l>
		<l>of God who takes away our sins was slain,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but with words plain and unambiguous,</l>
		<l>that loving father, hidden, yet revealed</l>
		<l>by his own smile, replied: &quot;Contingency,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>while not extending past the book in which</l>
		<l>your world of matter has been writ, is yet</l>
		<l>in the Eternal Vision all depicted</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>(but this does not imply necessity,</l>
		<l>just as a ship that sails downstream is not</l>
		<l>determined by the eye that watches it).</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And from that Vision-just as from an organ</l>
		<l>the ear receives a gentle harmony-</l>
		<l>what time prepares for you appears to me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Hippolytus was forced to leave his Athens</l>
		<l>because of his stepmother, faithless, fierce;</l>
		<l>and so must you depart from Florence: this</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>is willed already, sought for, soon to be</l>
		<l>accomplished by the one who plans and plots</l>
		<l>where-every day-Christ is both sold and bought.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The blame, as usual, will be cried out</l>
		<l>against the injured party; but just vengeance</l>
		<l>will serve as witness to the truth that wields it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You shall leave everything you love most dearly:</l>
		<l>this is the arrow that the bow of exile</l>
		<l>shoots first. You are to know the bitter taste</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of others&apos; bread, how salt it is, and know</l>
		<l>how hard a path it is for one who goes</l>
		<l>descending and ascending others&apos; stairs.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And what will be most hard for you to bear</l>
		<l>will be the scheming, senseless company</l>
		<l>that is to share your fall into this valley;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>against you they will be insane, completely</l>
		<l>ungrateful and profane; and yet, soon after,</l>
		<l>not you but they will have their brows bloodred.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Of their insensate acts, the proof will be</l>
		<l>in the effects; and thus, your honor will</l>
		<l>be best kept if your party is your self.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Your first refuge and your first inn shall be</l>
		<l>the courtesy of the great Lombard, he</l>
		<l>who on the ladder bears the sacred bird;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and so benign will be his care for you</l>
		<l>that, with you two, in giving and in asking,</l>
		<l>that shall be first which is, with others, last.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You shall-beside him-see one who, at birth,</l>
		<l>had so received the seal of this strong star</l>
		<l>that what he does will be remarkable.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>People have yet to notice him because</l>
		<l>he is a boy-for nine years and no more</l>
		<l>have these spheres wheeled around him-but before</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the Gascon gulls the noble Henry, some</l>
		<l>sparks will have marked the virtue of the Lombard:</l>
		<l>hard labor and his disregard for silver.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His generosity is yet to be</l>
		<l>so notable that even enemies</l>
		<l>will never hope to treat it silently.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Put trust in him and in his benefits:</l>
		<l>his gifts will bring much metamorphosis-</l>
		<l>rich men and beggars will exchange their states.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>What I tell you about him you will bear</l>
		<l>inscribed within your mind-but hide it there&quot;;</l>
		<l>and he told things beyond belief even</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for those who will yet see them. Then he added:</l>
		<l>&quot;Son, these are glosses of what you had heard;</l>
		<l>these are the snares that hide beneath brief years</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Yet I&apos;d not have you envying your neighbors;</l>
		<l>your life will long outlast the punishment</l>
		<l>that is to fall upon their treacheries.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>After that holy soul had, with his silence,</l>
		<l>showed he was freed from putting in the woof</l>
		<l>across the web whose warp I set for him,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I like a man who, doubting, craves for counsel</l>
		<l>from one who sees and rightly wills and loves,</l>
		<l>replied to him: &quot;I clearly see, my father,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>how time is hurrying toward me in order</l>
		<l>to deal me such a blow as would be most</l>
		<l>grievous for him who is not set for it;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>thus, it is right to arm myself with foresight,</l>
		<l>that if I lose the place most dear, I may</l>
		<l>not lose the rest through what my poems say.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Down in the world of endless bitterness,</l>
		<l>and on the mountain from whose lovely peak</l>
		<l>I was drawn upward by my lady&apos;s eyes,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and afterward, from light to light in Heaven,</l>
		<l>I learned that which, if I retell it, must</l>
		<l>for many have a taste too sharp, too harsh;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>yet if I am a timid friend of truth,</l>
		<l>I fear that I may lose my life among</l>
		<l>those who will call this present, ancient times.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The light in which there smiled the treasure I</l>
		<l>had found within it, first began to dazzle,</l>
		<l>as would a golden mirror in the sun,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>then it replied: &quot;A conscience that is dark-</l>
		<l>either through its or through another&apos;s shame-</l>
		<l>indeed will find that what you speak is harsh.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Nevertheless, all falsehood set aside,</l>
		<l>let all that you have seen be manifest,</l>
		<l>and let them scratch wherever it may itch.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For if, at the first taste, your words molest,</l>
		<l>they will, when they have been digested, end</l>
		<l>as living nourishment. As does the wind,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so shall your outcry do-the wind that sends</l>
		<l>its roughest blows against the highest peaks;</l>
		<l>that is no little cause for claiming honor.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Therefore, within these spheres, upon the mountain</l>
		<l>and in the dismal valley, you were shown</l>
		<l>only those souls that unto fame are known-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>because the mind of one who hears will not</l>
		<l>put doubt to rest, put trust in you, if given</l>
		<l>examples with their roots unknown and hidden,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>or arguments too dim, too unapparent.&quot;</l>
