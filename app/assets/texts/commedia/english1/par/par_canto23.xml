	<p>
		<l>As does the bird, among beloved branches,</l>
		<l>when, through the night that hides things from us,</l>
		<l>has rested near the nest of her sweet fledglings</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and, on an open branch, anticipates</l>
		<l>the time when she can see their longed-for faces</l>
		<l>and find the food with which to feed them-chore</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that pleases her, however hard her labors-</l>
		<l>as she awaits the sun with warm affection,</l>
		<l>steadfastly watching for the dawn to break:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so did my lady stand, erect, intent,</l>
		<l>turned toward that part of heaven under which</l>
		<l>the sun is given to less haste; so that,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>as I saw her in longing and suspense,</l>
		<l>I grew to be as one who, while he wants</l>
		<l>what is not his, is satisfied with hope.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But time between one and the other when</l>
		<l>was brief-I mean the whens of waiting and</l>
		<l>of seeing heaven grow more radiant.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And Beatrice said: &quot;There you see the troops</l>
		<l>of the triumphant Christ-and all the fruits</l>
		<l>ingathered from the turning of these spheres!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It seemed to me her face was all aflame,</l>
		<l>and there was so much gladness in her eyes-</l>
		<l>I am compelled to leave it undescribed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Like Trivia-at the full moon in clear skies-</l>
		<l>smiling among the everlasting nymphs who</l>
		<l>decorate all reaches of the sky,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw a sun above a thousand lamps;</l>
		<l>it kindled all of them as does our sun</l>
		<l>kindle the sights above us here on earth;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and through its living light the glowing Substance</l>
		<l>appeared to me with such intensity-</l>
		<l>my vision lacked the power to sustain it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O Beatrice, sweet guide and dear! She said</l>
		<l>to me: &quot;What overwhelms you is a Power</l>
		<l>against which nothing can defend itself.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This is the Wisdom and the Potency</l>
		<l>that opened roads between the earth and Heaven,</l>
		<l>the paths for which desire had long since waited.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even as lightning breaking from a cloud,</l>
		<l>expanding so that it cannot be pent,</l>
		<l>against its nature, down to earth, descends,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so did my mind, confronted by that feast,</l>
		<l>expand; and it was carried past itself-</l>
		<l>what it became, it cannot recollect.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Open your eyes and see what I now am;</l>
		<l>the things you witnessed will have made you strong</l>
		<l>enough to bear the power of my smile.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I was as one who, waking from a dream</l>
		<l>he has forgotten, tries in vain to bring</l>
		<l>that vision back into his memory,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when I heard what she offered me, deserving</l>
		<l>of so much gratitude that it can never</l>
		<l>be canceled from the book that tells the past.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If all the tongues that Polyhymnia</l>
		<l>together with her sisters made most rich</l>
		<l>with sweetest milk, should come now to assist</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>my singing of the holy smile that lit</l>
		<l>the holy face of Beatrice, the truth</l>
		<l>would not be reached-not its one-thousandth part.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And thus, in representing Paradise,</l>
		<l>the sacred poem has to leap across,</l>
		<l>as does a man who finds his path cut off.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But he who thinks upon the weighty theme,</l>
		<l>and on the mortal shoulder bearing it,</l>
		<l>will lay no blame if, burdened so, I tremble:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>this is no crossing for a little bark-</l>
		<l>the sea that my audacious prow now cleaves-</l>
		<l>nor for a helmsman who would spare himself.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Why are you so enraptured by my face</l>
		<l>as to deny your eyes the sight of that</l>
		<l>fair garden blossoming beneath Christ&apos;s rays?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The Rose in which the Word of God became</l>
		<l>flesh grows within that garden; there-the lilies</l>
		<l>whose fragrance let men find the righteous way.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus Beatrice, and I-completely ready</l>
		<l>to do what she might counsel-once again</l>
		<l>took up the battle of my feeble brows.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Under a ray of sun that, limpid, streams</l>
		<l>down from a broken cloud, my eyes have seen,</l>
		<l>while shade was shielding them, a flowered meadow;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so I saw many troops of splendors here</l>
		<l>lit from above by burning rays of light,</l>
		<l>but where those rays began was not in sight.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O kindly Power that imprints them thus,</l>
		<l>you rose on high to leave space for my eyes-</l>
		<l>for where I was, they were too weak to see You!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The name of that fair flower which I always</l>
		<l>invoke, at morning and at evening, drew</l>
		<l>my mind completely to the greatest flame.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And when, on both my eye-lights, were depicted</l>
		<l>the force and nature of the living star</l>
		<l>that conquers heaven as it conquered earth,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>descending through that sky there came a torch,</l>
		<l>forming a ring that seemed as if a crown:</l>
		<l>wheeling around her-a revolving garland.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Whatever melody most sweetly sounds</l>
		<l>on earth, and to itself most draws the soul,</l>
		<l>would seem a cloud that, torn by lightning, thunders,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>if likened to the music of that lyre</l>
		<l>which sounded from the crown of that fair sapphire</l>
		<l>the brightest light that has ensapphired heaven.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;I am angelic love who wheel around</l>
		<l>that high gladness inspired by the womb</l>
		<l>that was the dwelling place of our Desire;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so shall I circle, Lady of Heaven, until</l>
		<l>you, following your Son, have made that sphere</l>
		<l>supreme, still more divine by entering it.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So did the circulating melody,</l>
		<l>sealing itself, conclude; and all the other</l>
		<l>lights then resounded with the name of Mary.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The royal cloak of all the wheeling spheres</l>
		<l>within the universe, the heaven most</l>
		<l>intense, alive, most burning in the breath</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of God and in His laws and ordinance,</l>
		<l>was far above us at its inner shore,</l>
		<l>so distant that it still lay out of sight</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>from that point where I was; and thus my eyes</l>
		<l>possessed no power to follow that crowned flame,</l>
		<l>which mounted upward, following her Son.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And like an infant who, when it has taken</l>
		<l>its milk, extends its arms out to its mother,</l>
		<l>its feeling kindling into outward flame,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>each of those blessed splendors stretched its peak</l>
		<l>upward, so that the deep affection each</l>
		<l>possessed for Mary was made plain to me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then they remained within my sight, singing</l>
		<l>&quot;Regina coeli&quot; with such tenderness</l>
		<l>that my delight in that has never left me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Oh, in those richest coffers, what abundance</l>
		<l>is garnered up for those who, while below,</l>
		<l>on earth, were faithful workers when they sowed!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Here do they live, delighting in the treasure</l>
		<l>they earned with tears in Babylonian</l>
		<l>exile, where they had no concern for gold.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Here, under the high Son of God and Mary,</l>
		<l>together with the ancient and the new</l>
		<l>councils, he triumphs in his victory-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he who is keeper of the keys of glory.</l>
