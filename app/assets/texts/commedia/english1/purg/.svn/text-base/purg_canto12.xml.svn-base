		<l>As oxen, yoked, proceed abreast, so I</l>
		<l>moved with that burdened soul as long as my</l>
		<l>kind pedagogue allowed me to; but when</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he said: &quot;Leave him behind, and go ahead;</l>
		<l>for here it&apos;s fitting that with wings and oars</l>
		<l>each urge his boat along with all his force,&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I drew my body up again, erect-</l>
		<l>the stance most suitable to man-and yet</l>
		<l>the thoughts I thought were still submissive, bent</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now I was on my way, and willingly</l>
		<l>I followed in my teacher&apos;s steps, and we</l>
		<l>together showed what speed we could command.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He said to me: &quot;Look downward, for the way</l>
		<l>will offer you some solace if you pay</l>
		<l>attention to the pavement at your feet.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As, on the lids of pavement tombs, there are</l>
		<l>stone effigies of what the buried were</l>
		<l>before, so that the dead may be remembered;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and there, when memory-inciting only</l>
		<l>the pious-has renewed their mourning, men</l>
		<l>are often led to shed their tears again;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so did I see, but carved more skillfully,</l>
		<l>with greater sense of likeness, effigies</l>
		<l>on all the path protruding from the mountain.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw, to one side of the path, one who</l>
		<l>had been created nobler than all other</l>
		<l>beings, falling lightning-like from Heaven.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw, upon the other side, Briareus</l>
		<l>transfixed by the celestial shaft: he lay,</l>
		<l>ponderous, on the ground, in fatal cold.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw Thymbraeus, I saw Mars and Pallas,</l>
		<l>still armed, as they surrounded Jove, their father</l>
		<l>gazing upon the Giants&apos; scattered limbs.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw bewildered Nimrod at the foot</l>
		<l>of his great labor; watching him were those</l>
		<l>of Shinar who had shared his arrogance.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O Niobe, what tears afflicted me</l>
		<l>when, on that path, I saw your effigy</l>
		<l>among your slaughtered children, seven and seven!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O Saul, you were portrayed there as one who</l>
		<l>had died on his own sword, upon Gilboa,</l>
		<l>which never after knew the rain, the dew!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O mad Arachne, I saw you already</l>
		<l>half spider, wretched on the ragged remnants</l>
		<l>of work that you had wrought to your own hurt!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O Rehoboam, you whose effigy</l>
		<l>seems not to menace there, and yet you flee</l>
		<l>by chariot, terrified, though none pursues!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It also showed-that pavement of hard stone-</l>
		<l>how much Alcmaeon made his mother pay:</l>
		<l>the cost of the ill-omened ornament.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It showed the children of Sennacherib</l>
		<l>as they assailed their father in the temple,</l>
		<l>then left him, dead, behind them as they fled.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It showed the slaughter and the devastation</l>
		<l>wrought by Tomyris when she taunted Cyrus:</l>
		<l>&quot;You thirsted after blood; with blood I fill you.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It showed the rout of the Assyrians,</l>
		<l>sent reeling after Holofernes&apos; death,</l>
		<l>and also showed his body-what was left.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw Troy turned to caverns and to ashes;</l>
		<l>O Ilium, your effigy in stone-</l>
		<l>it showed you there so squalid, so cast down!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>What master of the brush or of the stylus</l>
		<l>had there portrayed such masses, such outlines</l>
		<l>as would astonish all discerning minds?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The dead seemed dead and the alive, alive:</l>
		<l>I saw, head bent, treading those effigies,</l>
		<l>as well as those who&apos;d seen those scenes directly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now, sons of Eve, persist in arrogance,</l>
		<l>in haughty stance, do not let your eyes bend,</l>
		<l>lest you be forced to see your evil path!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We now had circled round more of the mountain</l>
		<l>and much more of the sun&apos;s course had been crossed</l>
		<l>than I, my mind absorbed, had gauged, when he</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>who always looked ahead insistently,</l>
		<l>as he advanced, began: &quot;Lift up your eyes;</l>
		<l>it&apos;s time to set these images aside.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>See there an angel hurrying to meet us,</l>
		<l>and also see the sixth of the handmaidens</l>
		<l>returning from her service to the day.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Adorn your face and acts with reverence,</l>
		<l>that he be pleased to send us higher. Remember-</l>
		<l>today will never know another dawn.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I was so used to his insistent warnings</l>
		<l>against the loss of time; concerning that,</l>
		<l>his words to me could hardly be obscure.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That handsome creature came toward us; his clothes</l>
		<l>were white, and in his aspect he seemed like</l>
		<l>the trembling star that rises in the morning.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He opened wide his arms, then spread his wings;</l>
		<l>he said: &quot;Approach: the steps are close at hand;</l>
		<l>from this point on one can climb easily.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This invitation&apos;s answered by so few:</l>
		<l>o humankind, born for the upward flight,</l>
		<l>why are you driven back by wind so slight?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He led us to a cleft within the rock,</l>
		<l>and then he struck my forehead with his wing;</l>
		<l>that done, he promised me safe journeying.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As on the right, when one ascends the hill</l>
		<l>where-over Rubaconte&apos;s bridge-there stands</l>
		<l>the church that dominates the well-ruled city,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the daring slope of the ascent is broken</l>
		<l>by steps that were constructed in an age</l>
		<l>when record books and measures could be trusted,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so was the slope that plummets there so steeply</l>
		<l>down from the other ring made easier;</l>
		<l>but on this side and that, high rock encroaches.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>While we began to move in that direction,</l>
		<l>&quot;Beati pauperes spiritu&quot; was sung</l>
		<l>so sweetly-it can not be told in words.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>How different were these entryways from those</l>
		<l>of Hell! For here it is with song one enters;</l>
		<l>down there, it is with savage lamentations.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now we ascended by the sacred stairs,</l>
		<l>but I seemed to be much more light than I</l>
		<l>had been, before, along the level terrace.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this I asked: &quot;Master, tell me, what heavy</l>
		<l>weight has been lifted from me, so that I,</l>
		<l>in going, notice almost no fatigue?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He answered: &quot;When the P&apos;s that still remain</l>
		<l>upon your brow-now almost all are faint-</l>
		<l>have been completely, like this P. erased,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>your feet will be so mastered by good will</l>
		<l>that they not only will not feel travail</l>
		<l>but will delight when they are urged uphill.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I behaved like those who make their way</l>
		<l>with something on their head of which they&apos;re not</l>
		<l>aware, till others&apos; signs make them suspicious,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>at which, the hand helps them to ascertain;</l>
		<l>it seeks and finds and touches and provides</l>
		<l>the services that sight cannot supply;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so, with my right hand&apos;s outspread fingers, I</l>
		<l>found just six of the letters once inscribed</l>
		<l>by him who holds the keys, upon my forehead;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and as he watched me do this, my guide smiled.</l>
	</p>
