		<l>In that hour when the heat of day, defeated</l>
		<l>by Earth and, sometimes, Saturn, can no longer</l>
		<l>warm up the moon-sent cold, when geomancers</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>can, in the east, see their Fortuna major</l>
		<l>rising before the dawn along a path</l>
		<l>that will be darkened for it only briefly-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>a stammering woman came to me in dream:</l>
		<l>her eyes askew, and crooked on her feet,</l>
		<l>her hands were crippled, her complexion sallow.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I looked at her; and just as sun revives</l>
		<l>cold limbs that night made numb, so did my gaze</l>
		<l>loosen her tongue and then, in little time,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>set her contorted limbs in perfect order;</l>
		<l>and, with the coloring that love prefers,</l>
		<l>my eyes transformed the wanness of her features.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And when her speech had been set free, then she</l>
		<l>began to sing so, that it would have been</l>
		<l>most difficult for me to turn aside.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;I am,&quot; she sang, &quot;I am the pleasing siren,</l>
		<l>who in midsea leads mariners astray-</l>
		<l>there is so much delight in hearing me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I turned aside Ulysses, although he</l>
		<l>had longed to journey; who grows used to me</l>
		<l>seldom departs-I satisfy him so.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Her lips were not yet done when, there beside me,</l>
		<l>a woman showed herself, alert and saintly,</l>
		<l>to cast the siren into much confusion.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O Virgil, Virgil, tell me: who is this?&quot;</l>
		<l>she asked most scornfully; and he came forward,</l>
		<l>his eyes intent upon that honest one.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He seized the other, baring her in front,</l>
		<l>tearing her clothes, and showing me her belly;</l>
		<l>the stench that came from there awakened me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I moved my eyes, and my good master cried:</l>
		<l>&quot;At least three times I&apos;ve called you. Rise and come:</l>
		<l>let&apos;s find the opening where you may enter.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I rose; the daylight had already filled</l>
		<l>the circles of the sacred mountain-we</l>
		<l>were journeying with new sun at our back.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I followed him, bearing my brow like one</l>
		<l>whose thoughts have weighed him down, who bends as if</l>
		<l>he were the semiarch that forms a bridge,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and then I heard: &quot;Draw near; the pass is here,&quot;</l>
		<l>said in a manner so benign and gentle</l>
		<l>as, in our mortal land, one cannot hear.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He who addressed us so had open wings,</l>
		<l>white as a swan&apos;s; and he directed us</l>
		<l>upward, between two walls of the hard rock.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then he moved his plumes and, fanning us,</l>
		<l>affirmed that those &quot;Qui lugent&quot; would be blessed-</l>
		<l>their souls would be possessed of consolation.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;What makes you keep your eyes upon the ground?&quot;</l>
		<l>my guide began to say to me when both</l>
		<l>of us had climbed a little, past the angel.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I: &quot;What makes me move with such misgiving</l>
		<l>is a new vision: it has so beguiled me</l>
		<l>that I cannot relinquish thoughts of it.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;The one you saw,&quot; he said, &quot;that ancient witch-</l>
		<l>for her alone one must atone above;</l>
		<l>you saw how man can free himself from her.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Let that suffice, and hurry on your way;</l>
		<l>fasten your eyes upon the lure that&apos;s spun</l>
		<l>by the eternal King with His great spheres.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just like a falcon, who at first looks down,</l>
		<l>then, when the falconer has called, bends forward,</l>
		<l>craving the food that&apos;s ready for him there,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so l became-and so remained until,</l>
		<l>through the cleft rock that lets one climb above,</l>
		<l>I reached the point at which the circle starts.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When I was in the clearing, the fifth level,</l>
		<l>my eyes discovered people there who wept,</l>
		<l>lying upon the ground, all turned face down.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Adhaesit pavimento anima mea,&quot;</l>
		<l>I heard them say with sighs so deep that it</l>
		<l>was hard to comprehend the words they spoke.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O God&apos;s elect, whose sufferings both hope</l>
		<l>and justice make less difficult, direct</l>
		<l>us to the stairway meant for our ascent.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;If you come here but do not need to be</l>
		<l>prostrate, and you would find the path most quickly,</l>
		<l>then keep your right hand always to the outside.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So did the poet ask, so did reply</l>
		<l>come from a little way ahead; and I,</l>
		<l>hearing that voice reply, learned what was hidden.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I turned my eyes to find my master&apos;s eyes;</l>
		<l>at this, with a glad sign, he ratified</l>
		<l>what I had asked for with my eager eyes.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When, free to do as I had wanted to,</l>
		<l>I moved ahead and bent over that soul</l>
		<l>whose words- before-had made me notice him,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>saying: &quot;Spirit, within whom weeping ripens</l>
		<l>that without which there&apos;s no return to God,</l>
		<l>suspend awhile-for me-your greater care.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Tell me: Who were you? And why are your backs</l>
		<l>turned up? And there-where I, alive, set out-</l>
		<l>would you have me beseech some good for you?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;Why Heaven turns our backs</l>
		<l>against itself, you are to know; but first</l>
		<l>scias quod ego fui successor Petri.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Between Sestri and Chiavari descends</l>
		<l>a handsome river; and its name is set</l>
		<l>upon the upper portion of my crest.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For one month and a little more I learned</l>
		<l>how the great mantle weighs on him who&apos;d keep it</l>
		<l>out of the mire-all other weights seem feathers.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Alas, how tardy my conversion was!</l>
		<l>But when I had been named the Roman shepherd,</l>
		<l>then I discovered the deceit of life.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw that there the heart was not at rest,</l>
		<l>nor could I, in that life, ascend more high;</l>
		<l>so that, in me, love for this life was kindled.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Until that point I was a squalid soul,</l>
		<l>from God divided, wholly avaricious;</l>
		<l>now, as you see, I&apos;m punished here for that.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>What avarice enacts is here declared</l>
		<l>in the purgation of converted souls;</l>
		<l>the mountain has no punishment more bitter.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as we did not lift our eyes on high</l>
		<l>but set our sight on earthly things instead,</l>
		<l>so justice here impels our eyes toward earth.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As avarice annulled in us the love</l>
		<l>of any other good, and thus we lost</l>
		<l>our chance for righteous works, so justice here</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>fetters our hands and feet and holds us captive;</l>
		<l>and for as long as it may please our just</l>
		<l>Lord, here we&apos;ll be outstretched and motionless.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I&apos;d kneeled, wishing to speak: but just as I</l>
		<l>began-and through my voice alone-he sensed</l>
		<l>that I had meant to do him reverence.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;What reason makes you bend your body so?&quot;</l>
		<l>he said. And I to him: &quot;Your dignity</l>
		<l>made conscience sting me as I stood erect.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Brother, straighten your legs; rise up!&quot; he answe</l>
		<l>&quot;Don&apos;t be mistaken; I, with you and others,</l>
		<l>am but a fellow-servant of one Power.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If you have ever understood the holy</l>
		<l>sound of the Gospel that says &apos;Neque nubent,&apos;</l>
		<l>then you will see why I have spoken so.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now go your way: I&apos;d not have you stop longer;</l>
		<l>your staying here disturbs my lamentations,</l>
		<l>the tears that help me ripen what you mentioned.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Beyond, I have a niece whose name&apos;s Alagia;</l>
		<l>she in herself is good, as long as our</l>
		<l>house, by example, brings her not to evil;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and she alone is left to me beyond.&quot;</l>
	</p>
