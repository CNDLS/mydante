	<p>
		<l>The natural thirst that never can be quenched</l>
		<l>except by water that gives grace-the draught</l>
		<l>the simple woman of Samaria sought-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>tormented me; haste spurred me on the path</l>
		<l>crowded with souls, behind my guide; and I</l>
		<l>felt pity, though their pain was justified.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And here-even as Luke records for us</l>
		<l>that Christ, new-risen from his burial cave,</l>
		<l>appeared to two along his way-a shade</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>appeared; and he advanced behind our backs</l>
		<l>while we were careful not to trample on</l>
		<l>the outstretched crowd. We did not notice him</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>until he had addressed us with: &quot;God give</l>
		<l>you, o my brothers, peace!&quot; We turned at once;</l>
		<l>then, after offering suitable response,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Virgil began: &quot;And may that just tribunal</l>
		<l>which has consigned me to eternal exile</l>
		<l>place you in peace within the blessed assembly!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;What!&quot; he exclaimed, as we moved forward quickly.</l>
		<l>&quot;If God&apos;s not deemed you worthy of ascent,</l>
		<l>who&apos;s guided you so far along His stairs?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;If you observe the signs the angel traced</l>
		<l>upon this man,&quot; my teacher said, &quot;you&apos;ll see</l>
		<l>plainly-he&apos;s meant to reign with all the righteous</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but since she who spins night and day had not</l>
		<l>yet spun the spool that Clotho sets upon</l>
		<l>the distaff and adjusts for everyone,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>his soul, the sister of your soul and mine,</l>
		<l>in its ascent, could not-alone-have climbed</l>
		<l>here, for it does not see the way we see.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Therefore, I was brought forth from Hell&apos;s broad j</l>
		<l>to guide him in his going; I shall lead</l>
		<l>him just as far as where I teach can reach.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But tell me, if you can, why, just before,</l>
		<l>the mountain shook and shouted, all of it-</l>
		<l>for so it seemed-down to its sea-bathed shore.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His question threaded so the needle&apos;s eye</l>
		<l>of my desire that just the hope alone</l>
		<l>of knowing left my thirst more satisfied.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That other shade began: &quot;The sanctity</l>
		<l>of these slopes does not suffer anything</l>
		<l>that&apos;s without order or uncustomary.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This place is free from every perturbation:</l>
		<l>what heaven from itself and in itself</l>
		<l>receives may serve as cause here-no thing else.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Therefore, no rain, no hail, no snow, no dew,</l>
		<l>no hoarfrost falls here any higher than</l>
		<l>the stairs of entry with their three brief steps;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>neither thick clouds nor thin appear, nor flash</l>
		<l>of lightning; Thaumas&apos; daughter, who so often</l>
		<l>shifts places in your world, is absent here.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Dry vapor cannot climb up any higher</l>
		<l>than to the top of the three steps of which</l>
		<l>I spoke-where Peter&apos;s vicar plants his feet.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Below that point, there may be small or ample</l>
		<l>tremors; but here above, I know not why,</l>
		<l>no wind concealed in earth has ever caused</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>a tremor; for it only trembles here</l>
		<l>when some soul feels it&apos;s cleansed, so that it ris</l>
		<l>or stirs to climb on high; and that shout follows.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The will alone is proof of purity</l>
		<l>and, fully free, surprises soul into</l>
		<l>a change of dwelling place-effectively.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Soul had the will to climb before, but that</l>
		<l>will was opposed by longing to do penance</l>
		<l>(as once, to sin), instilled by divine justice.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I, who have lain in this suffering</l>
		<l>five hundred years and more, just now have felt</l>
		<l>my free will for a better threshold: thus,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>you heard the earthquake and the pious spirits</l>
		<l>throughout the mountain as they praised the Lord-</l>
		<l>and may He send them speedily upward.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So did he speak to us; and just as joy</l>
		<l>is greater when we quench a greater thirst,</l>
		<l>the joy he brought cannot be told in words.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And my wise guide: &quot;I now can see the net</l>
		<l>impeding you, how one slips through, and why</l>
		<l>it quakes here, and what makes you all rejoice.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And now may it please you to tell me who</l>
		<l>you were, and in your words may I find why</l>
		<l>you&apos;ve lain here for so many centuries.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;In that age when the worthy Titus, with</l>
		<l>help from the Highest King, avenged the wounds</l>
		<l>from which the blood that Judas sold had flowed,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I had sufficient fame beyond,&quot; that spirit</l>
		<l>replied; &quot;I bore the name that lasts the longest</l>
		<l>and honors most-but faith was not yet mine.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So gentle was the spirit of my verse</l>
		<l>that Rome drew me, son of Toulouse, to her,</l>
		<l>and there my brow deserved a crown of myrtle.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>On earth my name is still remembered-Statius:</l>
		<l>I sang of Thebes and then of great Achilles;</l>
		<l>I fell along the way of that last labor.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The sparks that warmed me, the seeds of my ardor,</l>
		<l>were from the holy fire-the same that gave</l>
		<l>more than a thousand poets light and flame.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I speak of the Aeneid; when I wrote</l>
		<l>verse, it was mother to me, it was nurse;</l>
		<l>my work, without it, would not weigh an ounce.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And to have lived on earth when Virgil lived-</l>
		<l>for that I would extend by one more year</l>
		<l>the time I owe before my exile&apos;s end.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These words made Virgil turn to me, and as</l>
		<l>he turned, his face, through silence, said: &quot;Be st</l>
		<l>(and yet the power of will cannot do all,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for tears and smiles are both so faithful to</l>
		<l>the feelings that have prompted them that true</l>
		<l>feeling escapes the will that would subdue).</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But I smiled like a man whose eyes would signal;</l>
		<l>at this, the shade was silent, and he stared</l>
		<l>where sentiment is clearest-at my eyes-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and said: &quot;So may your trying labor end</l>
		<l>successfully, do tell me why-just now-</l>
		<l>your face showed me the flashing of a smile.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now I am held by one side and the other:</l>
		<l>one keeps me still, the other conjures me</l>
		<l>to speak; but when, therefore, I sigh, my master</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>knows why and tells me: &quot;Do not be afraid</l>
		<l>to speak, but speak and answer what he has</l>
		<l>asked you to tell him with such earnestness.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this, I answered: &quot;Ancient spirit, you</l>
		<l>perhaps are wondering at the smile I smiled:</l>
		<l>but I would have you feel still more surprise.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He who is guide, who leads my eyes on high,</l>
		<l>is that same Virgil from whom you derived</l>
		<l>the power to sing of men and of the gods.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Do not suppose my smile had any source</l>
		<l>beyond the speech you spoke; be sure-it was</l>
		<l>those words you said of him that were the cause.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now he had bent to kiss my teacher&apos;s feet,</l>
		<l>but Virgil told him: &quot;Brother, there&apos;s no need-</l>
		<l>you are a shade, a shade is what you see.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And, rising, he: &quot;Now you can understand</l>
		<l>how much love burns in me for you, when I</l>
		<l>forget our insubstantiality,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>treating the shades as one treats solid things.&quot;</l>
