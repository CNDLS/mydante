		<l>While I was peering so intently through</l>
		<l>the green boughs, like a hunter who, so used,</l>
		<l>would waste his life in chasing after birds,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>my more than father said to me: &quot;Now come,</l>
		<l>son, for the time our journey can permit</l>
		<l>is to be used more fruitfully than this.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I turned my eyes, and I was no less quick</l>
		<l>to turn my steps; I followed those two sages,</l>
		<l>whose talk was such, my going brought no loss.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And-there!-&quot;Labia mea, Domine&quot;</l>
		<l>was wept and sung and heard in such a manner</l>
		<l>that it gave birth to both delight and sorrow.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O gentle father, what is this I hear?&quot;</l>
		<l>I asked. And he: &quot;Perhaps they&apos;re shades who go</l>
		<l>loosening the knot of what they owe.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even as pensive pilgrims do, who when</l>
		<l>they&apos;ve overtaken folk unknown to them</l>
		<l>along the way, will turn but will not stop,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so, overtaking us-they had come from</l>
		<l>behind but were more swift-a crowd of souls,</l>
		<l>devout and silent, looked at us in wonder.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Each shade had dark and hollow eyes; their faces</l>
		<l>were pale and so emaciated that</l>
		<l>their taut skin took its shape from bones beneath.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I don&apos;t believe that even Erysichthon</l>
		<l>had been so dried, down to his very hide,</l>
		<l>by hunger, when his fast made him fear most.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thinking, I told myself: &quot;I see the people</l>
		<l>who lost Jerusalem, when Mary plunged</l>
		<l>her beak into her son.&quot; The orbits of</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>their eyes seemed like a ring that&apos;s lost its gems</l>
		<l>and he who, in the face of man, would read</l>
		<l>OMO would here have recognized the M.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Who-if he knew not how-would have believed</l>
		<l>that longing born from odor of a tree,</l>
		<l>odor of water, could reduce souls so?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I was already wondering what had</l>
		<l>so famished them (for I had not yet learned</l>
		<l>the reason for their leanness and sad scurf),</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when-there!-a shade, his eyes deep in his head,</l>
		<l>turned toward me, staring steadily; and then</l>
		<l>he cried aloud: &quot;What grace is granted me!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I never would have recognized him by</l>
		<l>his face; and yet his voice made plain to me</l>
		<l>what his appearance had obliterated.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This spark rekindled in me everything</l>
		<l>I knew about those altered features; thus,</l>
		<l>I realized it was Forese&apos;s face.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Ah, don&apos;t reproach me for the dried-out scabs</l>
		<l>that stain my skin,&quot; he begged, &quot;nor for the lack</l>
		<l>of flesh on me; but do tell me the truth</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>about yourself, do tell me who those two</l>
		<l>souls there are, those who are escorting you;</l>
		<l>may you not keep yourself from speaking to me!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Your face, which I once wept on when you died,&quot;</l>
		<l>I answered him, &quot;now gives me no less cause</l>
		<l>for sad lament, seeing you so deformed</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But tell me, for God&apos;s sake, what has unleaved</l>
		<l>you so; don&apos;t make me speak while I&apos;m amazed-</l>
		<l>he who&apos;s distracted answers clumsily.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;From the eternal counsel,</l>
		<l>the water and the tree you left behind</l>
		<l>receive the power that makes me waste away.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>All of these souls who, grieving, sing because</l>
		<l>their appetite was gluttonous, in thirst</l>
		<l>and hunger here resanctify themselves.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The fragrance of the fruit and of the water</l>
		<l>that&apos;s sprayed through that green tree kindles in </l>
		<l>craving for food and drink; and not once only,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>as we go round this space, our pain&apos;s renewed-</l>
		<l>I speak of pain but I should speak of solace,</l>
		<l>for we are guided to those trees by that</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>same longing that had guided Christ when He</l>
		<l>had come to free us through the blood He shed</l>
		<l>and, in His joyousness, called out: &apos;Eli.&apos;&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I to him: &quot;Forese, from that day</l>
		<l>when you exchanged the world for better life</l>
		<l>until now, less than five years have revolved;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and if you waited for the moment when</l>
		<l>the power to sin was gone before you found</l>
		<l>the hour of the good grief that succors us</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and weds us once again to God, how have</l>
		<l>you come so quickly here? I thought to find</l>
		<l>you down below, where time must pay for time.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;It is my Nella who,</l>
		<l>with her abundant tears, has guided me</l>
		<l>to drink the sweet wormwood of torments: she,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>with sighs and prayers devout has set me free</l>
		<l>of that slope where one waits and has freed me</l>
		<l>from circles underneath this circle. She-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>my gentle widow, whom I loved most dearly-</l>
		<l>was all the more beloved and prized by God</l>
		<l>as she is more alone in her good works.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For even the Barbagia of Sardinia</l>
		<l>is far more modest in its women than</l>
		<l>is that Barbagia where I left her. O</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>sweet brother, what would you have had me say?</l>
		<l>A future time&apos;s already visible</l>
		<l>to me-a time not too far-off from now-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when, from the pulpit, it shall be forbidden</l>
		<l>to those immodest ones-Florentine women-</l>
		<l>to go displaying bosoms with bare paps.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>What ordinances-spiritual, civil-</l>
		<l>were ever needed by barbarian or</l>
		<l>Saracen women to make them go covered?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But if those shameless ones had certain knowledge</l>
		<l>of what swift Heaven&apos;s readying for them,</l>
		<l>then they would have mouths open now to howl;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for if our foresight here does not deceive me,</l>
		<l>they will be sad before the cheeks of those</l>
		<l>whom lullabies can now appease grow beards.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Ah, brother, do not hide things any longer!</l>
		<l>You see that I am not alone, for all</l>
		<l>these people stare at where you veil the sun.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this I said to him: &quot;If you should call</l>
		<l>to mind what you have been with me and I</l>
		<l>with you, remembering now will still be heavy.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He who precedes me turned me from that life</l>
		<l>some days ago, when she who is the sister</l>
		<l>of him&quot;-I pointed to the sun-&quot;was showing</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>her roundness to you. It is he who&apos;s led</l>
		<l>me through the deep night of the truly dead</l>
		<l>with this true flesh that follows after him.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His help has drawn me up from there, climbing</l>
		<l>and circling round this mountain, which makes stra</l>
		<l>you whom the world made crooked. And he says</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that he will bear me company until</l>
		<l>I reach the place where Beatrice is; there</l>
		<l>I must remain without him. It is Virgil</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>who speaks to me in this way,&quot; and I pointed</l>
		<l>to him; &quot;this other is the shade for whom,</l>
		<l>just now, your kingdom caused its every slope</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to tremble as it freed him from itself.&quot;</l>
