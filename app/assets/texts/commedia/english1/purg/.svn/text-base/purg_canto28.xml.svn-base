	<p>
		<l>Now keen to search within, to search around</l>
		<l>that forest-dense, alive with green, divine-</l>
		<l>which tempered the new day before my eyes,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>without delay, I left behind the rise</l>
		<l>and took the plain, advancing slowly, slowly</l>
		<l>across the ground where every part was fragrant.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>A gentle breeze, which did not seem to vary</l>
		<l>within itself, was striking at my brow</l>
		<l>but with no greater force than a kind wind&apos;s,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>a wind that made the trembling boughs-they all</l>
		<l>bent eagerly-incline in the direction</l>
		<l>of morning shadows from the holy mountain;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but they were not deflected with such force</l>
		<l>as to disturb the little birds upon</l>
		<l>the branches in the practice of their arts;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for to the leaves, with song, birds welcomed those</l>
		<l>first hours of the morning joyously,</l>
		<l>and leaves supplied the burden to their rhymes-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>just like the wind that sounds from branch to bran</l>
		<l>along the shore of Classe, through the pines</l>
		<l>when Aeolus has set Sirocco loose.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now, though my steps were slow, I&apos;d gone so far</l>
		<l>into the ancient forest that I could</l>
		<l>no longer see where I had made my entry;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and there I came upon a stream that blocked</l>
		<l>the path of my advance; its little waves</l>
		<l>bent to the left the grass along its banks.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>All of the purest waters here on earth,</l>
		<l>when matched against that stream, would seem to be</l>
		<l>touched by impurity; it hides no thing-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that stream-although it moves, dark, dark, beneath</l>
		<l>the never-ending shadows, which allow</l>
		<l>no ray of sun or moon to reach those waters.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I halted, and I set my eyes upon</l>
		<l>the farther bank, to look at the abundant</l>
		<l>variety of newly-flowered boughs;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and there, just like a thing that, in appearing</l>
		<l>most suddenly, repels all other thoughts,</l>
		<l>so great is the astonishment it brings,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw a solitary woman moving,</l>
		<l>singing, and gathering up flower on flower-</l>
		<l>the flowers that colored all of her pathway.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;I pray you, lovely lady, you who warm</l>
		<l>yourself with rays of love, if I may trust</l>
		<l>your looks-which often evidence the heart-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>may it please you,&quot; I asked of her, &quot;to move</l>
		<l>ahead and closer to this river, so</l>
		<l>that I may understand what you are singing.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You have reminded me of where and what-</l>
		<l>just when her mother was deprived of her</l>
		<l>and she deprived of spring-Proserpina was.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As, when she turns, a woman, dancing, keeps</l>
		<l>her soles close to the ground and to each other</l>
		<l>and scarcely lets one foot precede the other,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so did she turn, upon the little red</l>
		<l>and yellow flowers, to me, no differently</l>
		<l>than would a virgin, lowering chaste eyes.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I had beseeched, and I was satisfied,</l>
		<l>for she approached so close that the sweet sound</l>
		<l>that reached me then became intelligible.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No sooner had she reached the point where that</l>
		<l>fair river&apos;s waves could barely bathe the grass,</l>
		<l>than she gave me this gift: lifting her eyes.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I do not think a light so bright had shone</l>
		<l>beneath the lids of Venus when her son</l>
		<l>pierced her in extraordinary fashion.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Erect, along the farther bank, she smiled,</l>
		<l>her hands entwining varicolored flowers,</l>
		<l>which that high land, needing no seed, engenders.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The river kept us just three steps apart;</l>
		<l>but even Hellespont, where Xerxes crossed-</l>
		<l>a case that still curbs all men&apos;s arrogance-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>did not provoke more hatred in Leander</l>
		<l>when rough seas ran from Abydos to Sestos,</l>
		<l>than hatred I bestowed upon that river</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when it refused to open. She began:</l>
		<l>&quot;You are new here and may-because I smile</l>
		<l>in this place, chosen to be mankind&apos;s nest-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>wonder, perplexed, unable to detect</l>
		<l>the cause; but light to clear your intellect</l>
		<l>is in the psalm beginning &apos;Delectasti.&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And you, who have stepped forward, who beseeched m</l>
		<l>tell me if you&apos;d hear more; I have come ready</l>
		<l>for all your questions till you&apos;re satisfied.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I said: &quot;The water and the murmuring forest</l>
		<l>contend, in me, against the recent credence</l>
		<l>I gave to words denying their existence.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this, she said: &quot;I&apos;ll tell you how the source</l>
		<l>of your amazement has its special cause;</l>
		<l>I&apos;ll clear the cloud that&apos;s left you so distraught</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The Highest Good, whose sole joy is Himself,</l>
		<l>made man to be-and to enact-good; He</l>
		<l>gave man this place as pledge of endless peace.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Man&apos;s fault made brief his stay here; and man&apos;s fa</l>
		<l>made him exchange frank laughter and sweet sport</l>
		<l>for lamentation and for anxiousness.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Below this mountain, land and water vapors,</l>
		<l>which follow heat as far as they are able,</l>
		<l>produce their perturbations; to prevent</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>them from molesting man placed here, this mountain</l>
		<l>rose up this close to Heaven; from the point</l>
		<l>where its gate locks, it&apos;s free of such disturbanc</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now, since all of the atmosphere revolves</l>
		<l>within a circle, moved by the first circling,</l>
		<l>unless its round is broken at some point,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>against this height, which stands completely free</l>
		<l>within the living air, that motion strikes;</l>
		<l>and since these woods are dense, they echo it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And when a plant is struck, its power is such</l>
		<l>that it impregnates air with seeding force;</l>
		<l>the air, revolving, casts this seed abroad;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the other hemisphere, depending on</l>
		<l>the nature of its land and sky, conceives</l>
		<l>and bears, from diverse powers, diverse trees.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If what I&apos;ve said were known, you would not need</l>
		<l>to be amazed on earth when growing things</l>
		<l>take root but have no seed that can be seen.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And you must know: the holy plain on which</l>
		<l>you find yourself is full of every seed;</l>
		<l>and it has fruit that-there-cannot be gathered.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The water that you see does not spring from</l>
		<l>a vein that vapor-cold-condensed-restores,</l>
		<l>like rivers that acquire or lose their force;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>it issues from a pure and changeless fountain,</l>
		<l>which by the will of God regains as much</l>
		<l>as, on two sides, it pours and it divides.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>On this side it descends with power to end</l>
		<l>one&apos;s memory of sin; and on the other,</l>
		<l>it can restore recall of each good deed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>To one side, it is Lethe; on the other,</l>
		<l>Eunoe; neither stream is efficacious</l>
		<l>unless the other&apos;s waters have been tasted:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>their savor is above all other sweetness.</l>
		<l>Although your thirst might well be satisfied</l>
		<l>even if I revealed no more to you,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I&apos;ll give you freely, too, a corollary;</l>
		<l>nor do I think my words will be less welcome</l>
		<l>to you if they extend beyond my promise.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Those ancients who in poetry presented</l>
		<l>the golden age, who sang its happy state,</l>
		<l>perhaps, in their Parnassus, dreamt this place.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Here, mankind&apos;s root was innocent; and here</l>
		<l>were every fruit and never-ending spring;</l>
		<l>these streams-the nectar of which poets sing.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I turned round completely, and I faced</l>
		<l>my poets; I could see that they had heard</l>
		<l>with smiles this final corollary spoken;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that done, my eyes returned to the fair woman.</l>
