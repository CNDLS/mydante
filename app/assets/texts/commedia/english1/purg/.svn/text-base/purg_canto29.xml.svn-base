	<p>
		<l>Her words were done, but without interruption</l>
		<l>she sang-like an enamored woman-thus:</l>
		<l>&quot;Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And just as nymphs who used to walk alone</l>
		<l>among the woodland shadows, some desiring</l>
		<l>to see and some to flee the sun, so she</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>moved countercurrent as she walked along</l>
		<l>the riverbank; and following her short</l>
		<l>footsteps with my own steps, I matched her pace.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Her steps and mine together did not sum</l>
		<l>one hundred when the banks, still parallel,</l>
		<l>so curved about that I was facing east.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Nor had we gone much farther on that path</l>
		<l>when she turned fully round toward me and said:</l>
		<l>&quot;My brother, look and listen&quot;; and I saw</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>a sudden radiance that swept across</l>
		<l>the mighty forest on all sides-and I</l>
		<l>was wondering if lightning had not struck.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But since, when lightning strikes, it stops at onc</l>
		<l>while that light, lingering, increased its force,</l>
		<l>within my mind I asked: &quot;What thing is this?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And through the incandescent air there ran</l>
		<l>sweet melody; at which, just indignation</l>
		<l>made me rebuke the arrogance of Eve</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>because, where earth and heaven were obedient,</l>
		<l>a solitary woman, just created,</l>
		<l>found any veil at all beyond endurance;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>if she had been devout beneath her veil,</l>
		<l>I should have savored those ineffable</l>
		<l>delights before, and for a longer time.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>While I moved on, completely rapt, among</l>
		<l>so many first fruits of eternal pleasure,</l>
		<l>and longing for still greater joys, the air</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>before us altered underneath the green</l>
		<l>branches, becoming like an ardent fire,</l>
		<l>and now the sweet sound was distinctly song.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O Virgins, sacrosanct, if I have ever,</l>
		<l>for your sake, suffered vigils, cold, and hunger,</l>
		<l>great need makes me entreat my recompense.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now Helicon must pour its fountains for me,</l>
		<l>Urania must help me with her choir</l>
		<l>to put in verses things hard to conceive.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Not far beyond, we made out seven trees</l>
		<l>of gold, though the long stretch of air between</l>
		<l>those trees and us had falsified their semblance;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but when I&apos;d drawn so close that things perceived</l>
		<l>through mingled senses, which delude, did not,</l>
		<l>now they were nearer, lose their real features,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the power that offers reason matter judged</l>
		<l>those trees to be-what they were-candelabra,</l>
		<l>and what those voices sang to be &quot;Hosanna.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The upper part of those fair candles flamed</l>
		<l>more radiantly than the midmonth moon</l>
		<l>shines at midnight in an untroubled sky.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Full of astonishment, I turned to my</l>
		<l>good Virgil; but he only answered me</l>
		<l>with eyes that were no less amazed than mine.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I looked at the extraordinary</l>
		<l>things that were moving toward us-but so slowly</l>
		<l>that even brides just wed would move more quickly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The woman chided me: &quot;Why are you only</l>
		<l>so eager to behold the living lights</l>
		<l>and not in seeing what comes after them?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I saw people following those candles,</l>
		<l>as if behind their guides, and they wore white-</l>
		<l>whiteness that, in this world, has never been.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The water, to my left, reflected flames,</l>
		<l>and it reflected, too, my left-hand side</l>
		<l>if I gazed into it, as in a mirror.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When I was at a point along my shore</l>
		<l>where all that sundered me from them was water,</l>
		<l>I stayed my steps in order to see better,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and I could see the candle flames move forward,</l>
		<l>leaving the air behind them colored like</l>
		<l>the strokes a painter&apos;s brush might have described</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so that the air above that retinue</l>
		<l>was streaked with seven bands in every hue</l>
		<l>of which the rainbow&apos;s made and Delia&apos;s girdle.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These pennants stretched far back, beyond my visio</l>
		<l>as for the width they filled, I judged the distanc</l>
		<l>between the outer ones to be ten paces.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Beneath the handsome sky I have described,</l>
		<l>twenty-four elders moved on, two by two,</l>
		<l>and they had wreaths of lilies on their heads.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And all were singing: &quot;You, among the daughters</l>
		<l>of Adam, benedicta are; and may</l>
		<l>your beauties blessed be eternally.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>After the flowers and the other fresh</l>
		<l>plants facing me, along the farther shore,</l>
		<l>had seen those chosen people disappear,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>then-as in heaven, star will follow star-</l>
		<l>the elders gone, four animals came on;</l>
		<l>and each of them had green leaves as his crown;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>each had six wings as plumage, and those plumes</l>
		<l>were full of eyes; they would be very like</l>
		<l>the eyes of Argus, were his eyes alive.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Reader, I am not squandering more rhymes</l>
		<l>in order to describe their forms; since I</l>
		<l>must spend elsewhere, I can&apos;t be lavish here;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but read Ezekiel, for he has drawn</l>
		<l>those animals approaching from the north;</l>
		<l>with wings and cloud and fire, he painted them.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And just as you will find them in his pages,</l>
		<l>such were they here, except that John&apos;s with me</l>
		<l>as to their wings; with him, John disagrees.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The space between the four of them contained</l>
		<l>a chariot-triumphal-on two wheels,</l>
		<l>tied to a griffin&apos;s neck and drawn by him.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His wings, stretched upward, framed the middle ban</l>
		<l>with three bands on each outer side, so that,</l>
		<l>though he cleaved air, he left the bands intact.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His wings-so high that they were lost to sight;</l>
		<l>his limbs were gold as far as he was bird;</l>
		<l>the rest of him was white mixed with bloodred.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Not only did no chariot so handsome</l>
		<l>gladden Rome&apos;s Africanus or Augustus</l>
		<l>himself-even the Sun&apos;s own cannot match it;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the Sun&apos;s-which, gone astray, was burnt to cinders</l>
		<l>because Earth offered up her pious prayers,</l>
		<l>when Jove, in ways not known to us, was just.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Three circling women, then advancing, danced:</l>
		<l>at the right wheel; the first of them, so red</l>
		<l>that even in a flame she&apos;d not be noted;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the second seemed as if her flesh and bone</l>
		<l>were fashioned out of emerald; the third</l>
		<l>seemed to be newly fallen snow. And now</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the white one seemed to lead them, now the red;</l>
		<l>and from the way in which the leader chanted,</l>
		<l>the others took their pace, now slow, now rapid.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Upon the left, four other women, dressed</l>
		<l>in crimson, danced, depending on the cadence</l>
		<l>of one of them, with three eyes in her head.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Behind all of the group I have described</l>
		<l>I saw two elders, different in their dress</l>
		<l>but like in manner-grave and decorous.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The first seemed to be one of the disciples</l>
		<l>of great Hippocrates, whom nature made</l>
		<l>for those who are her dearest living beings;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the other showed an opposite concern-</l>
		<l>his sword was bright and sharp, and even on</l>
		<l>this near side of the river, I felt fear.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I saw four of humble aspect; and,</l>
		<l>when all the rest had passed, a lone old man,</l>
		<l>his features keen, advanced, as if in sleep.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The clothes these seven wore were like the elders&apos;</l>
		<l>in the first file, except that these had no</l>
		<l>garlands of lilies round their brow; instead,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>roses and other red flowers wreathed their heads;</l>
		<l>one seeing them less closely would have sworn</l>
		<l>that all of them had flames above their eyebrows.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And when the chariot stood facing me,</l>
		<l>I heard a bolt of thunder; and it seemed</l>
		<l>to block the path of that good company,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>which halted there, its emblems in the lead.</l>
