	<p>
		<l>&quot;O you upon the holy stream&apos;s far shore,&quot;</l>
		<l>so she, turning her speech&apos;s point against me-</l>
		<l>even its edge had seemed too sharp-began</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>again, without allowing interruption,</l>
		<l>&quot;tell, tell if this is true; for your confession</l>
		<l>must be entwined with such self-accusation.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My power of speech was so confounded that</l>
		<l>my voice would move and yet was spent before</l>
		<l>its organs had released it. She forbore</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>a moment, then she said: &quot;What are you thinking?</l>
		<l>Reply to me, the water has not yet</l>
		<l>obliterated your sad memories.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Confusion mixed with fear compelled a Yes</l>
		<l>out of my mouth, and yet that Yes was such-</l>
		<l>one needed eyes to make out what it was.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as a crossbow that is drawn too taut</l>
		<l>snaps both its cord and bow when it is shot,</l>
		<l>and arrow meets its mark with feeble force,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so, caught beneath that heavy weight, I burst;</l>
		<l>and I let tears and sighs pour forth; my voice</l>
		<l>had lost its life along its passage out.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this she said: &quot;In the desire for me</l>
		<l>that was directing you to love the Good</l>
		<l>beyond which there&apos;s no thing to draw our longing,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>what chains were strung, what ditches dug across</l>
		<l>your path that, once you&apos;d come upon them, caused</l>
		<l>your loss of any hope of moving forward?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>What benefits and what allurements were</l>
		<l>so evident upon the brow of others</l>
		<l>that you had need to promenade before them?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>After I had withheld a bitter sigh,</l>
		<l>I scarcely had the voice for my reply,</l>
		<l>but, laboring, my lips gave my words form.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Weeping, I answered: &quot;Mere appearances</l>
		<l>turned me aside with their false loveliness,</l>
		<l>as soon as I had lost your countenance.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And she: &quot;Had you been silent or denied</l>
		<l>what you confess, your guilt would not be less</l>
		<l>in evidence: it&apos;s known by such a Judge!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But when the charge of sinfulness has burst</l>
		<l>from one&apos;s own cheek, then in our court the whet-</l>
		<l>stone turns and blunts our blade&apos;s own cutting edg</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Nevertheless, that you may feel more shame</l>
		<l>for your mistake, and that-in time to come-</l>
		<l>hearing the Sirens, you may be more strong,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>have done with all the tears you sowed, and listen</l>
		<l>so shall you hear how, unto other ends,</l>
		<l>my buried flesh should have directed you.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Nature or art had never showed you any</l>
		<l>beauty that matched the lovely limbs in which</l>
		<l>I was enclosed-limbs scattered now in dust;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and if the highest beauty failed you through</l>
		<l>my death, what mortal thing could then induce</l>
		<l>you to desire it? For when the first</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>arrow of things deceptive struck you, then</l>
		<l>you surely should have lifted up your wings</l>
		<l>to follow me, no longer such a thing.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No green young girl or other novelty-</l>
		<l>such brief delight-should have weighed down your w</l>
		<l>awaiting further shafts. The fledgling bird</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>must meet two or three blows before he learns,</l>
		<l>but any full-fledged bird is proof against</l>
		<l>the net that has been spread or arrow, aimed.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As children, when ashamed, will stand, their eyes</l>
		<l>upon the ground-they listen, silently,</l>
		<l>acknowledging their fault repentantly-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so did I stand; and she enjoined me: &quot;Since</l>
		<l>hearing alone makes you grieve so, lift up</l>
		<l>your beard, and sight will bring you greater tears</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There&apos;s less resistance in the sturdy oak</l>
		<l>to its uprooting by a wind from lands</l>
		<l>of ours or lands of Iarbas than I showed</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>in lifting up my chin at her command;</l>
		<l>I knew quite well-when she said &quot;beard&quot; but meant</l>
		<l>my face-the poison in her argument.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When I had raised my face upright, my eyes</l>
		<l>were able to perceive that the first creatures</l>
		<l>had paused and were no longer scattering flowers;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and still uncertain of itself, my vision</l>
		<l>saw Beatrice turned toward the animal</l>
		<l>that is, with its two natures, but one person.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Beneath her veil, beyond the stream, she seemed</l>
		<l>so to surpass her former self in beauty</l>
		<l>as, here on earth, she had surpassed all others.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The nettle of remorse so stung me then,</l>
		<l>that those-among all other-things that once</l>
		<l>most lured my love, became most hateful to me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Such self-indictment seized my heart that I</l>
		<l>collapsed, my senses slack; what I became</l>
		<l>is known to her who was the cause of it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then, when my heart restored my outer sense,</l>
		<l>I saw the woman whom I&apos;d found alone,</l>
		<l>standing above me, saying: &quot;Hold, hold me!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>She&apos;d plunged me, up to my throat, in the river,</l>
		<l>and, drawing me behind her, she now crossed,</l>
		<l>light as a gondola, along the surface.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When I was near the blessed shore, I heard</l>
		<l>&quot;Asperges me&quot; so sweetly sung that I</l>
		<l>cannot remember or, much less, transcribe it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The lovely woman opened wide her arms;</l>
		<l>she clasped my head, and then she thrust me under</l>
		<l>to that point where I had to swallow water.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That done, she drew me out and led me, bathed,</l>
		<l>into the dance of the four lovely women;</l>
		<l>and each one placed her arm above my head.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Here we are nymphs; in heaven, stars; before</l>
		<l>she had descended to the world, we were</l>
		<l>assigned, as her handmaids, to Beatrice;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>we&apos;ll be your guides unto her eyes; but it</l>
		<l>will be the three beyond, who see more deeply,</l>
		<l>who&apos;ll help you penetrate her joyous light.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So, singing, they began; then, leading me</l>
		<l>together with them to the griffin&apos;s breast,</l>
		<l>where Beatrice, turned toward us, stood, they said</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;See that you are not sparing of your gaze:</l>
		<l>before you we have set those emeralds</l>
		<l>from which Love once had aimed his shafts at you.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>A thousand longings burning more than flames</l>
		<l>compelled my eyes to watch the radiant eyes</l>
		<l>that, motionless, were still fixed on the griffin.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just like the sun within a mirror, so</l>
		<l>the double-natured creature gleamed within,</l>
		<l>now showing one, and now the other guise.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Consider, reader, if I did not wonder</l>
		<l>when I saw something that displayed no movement</l>
		<l>though its reflected image kept on changing.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And while, full of astonishment and gladness,</l>
		<l>my soul tasted that food which, even as</l>
		<l>it quenches hunger, spurs the appetite,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the other three, whose stance showed them to be</l>
		<l>the members of a higher troop, advanced-</l>
		<l>and, to their chant, they danced angelically.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Turn, Beatrice, o turn your holy eyes</l>
		<l>upon your faithful one,&quot; their song beseeched,</l>
		<l>&quot;who, that he might see you, has come so far.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Out of your grace, do us this grace; unveil</l>
		<l>your lips to him, so that he may discern</l>
		<l>the second beauty you have kept concealed.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O splendor of eternal living light,</l>
		<l>who&apos;s ever grown so pale beneath Parnassus&apos;</l>
		<l>shade or has drunk so deeply from its fountain,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that he&apos;d not seem to have his mind confounded,</l>
		<l>trying to render you as you appeared</l>
		<l>where heaven&apos;s harmony was your pale likeness-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>your face, seen through the air, unveiled complete</l>
	</p>
