	<p>
		<l>When any of our faculties retains</l>
		<l>a strong impression of delight or pain,</l>
		<l>the soul will wholly concentrate on that,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>neglecting any other power it has</l>
		<l>(and this refutes the error that maintains</l>
		<l>that-one above the other-several souls</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>can flame in us); and thus, when something seen</l>
		<l>or heard secures the soul in stringent grip,</l>
		<l>time moves and yet we do not notice it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The power that perceives the course of time</l>
		<l>is not the power that captures all the mind;</l>
		<l>the former has no force-the latter binds.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I confirmed this by experience,</l>
		<l>hearing that spirit in my wonderment;</l>
		<l>for though the sun had fully climbed fifty</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>degrees, I had not noticed it, when we</l>
		<l>came to the point at which in unison</l>
		<l>those souls cried out to us: &quot;Here&apos;s what you want</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The farmer, when the grape is darkening,</l>
		<l>will often stuff a wider opening</l>
		<l>with just a little forkful of his thorns,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>than was the gap through which my guide and I,</l>
		<l>who followed after, climbed, we two alone,</l>
		<l>after that company of souls had gone.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>San Leo can be climbed, one can descend</l>
		<l>to Noli and ascend Cacume and</l>
		<l>Bismantova with feet alone, but</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I had to fly: I mean with rapid wings</l>
		<l>and pinions of immense desire, behind</l>
		<l>the guide who gave me hope and was my light.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We made our upward way through rifted rock;</l>
		<l>along each side the edges pressed on us;</l>
		<l>the ground beneath required feet and hands.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When we had reached the upper rim of that</l>
		<l>steep bank, emerging on the open slope,</l>
		<l>I said: &quot;My master, what way shall we take?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;Don&apos;t squander any steps;</l>
		<l>keep climbing up the mountain after me</l>
		<l>until we find some expert company.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The summit was so high, my sight fell short;</l>
		<l>the slope was far more steep than the line drawn</l>
		<l>from middle-quadrant to the center point.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I was exhausted when I made this plea:</l>
		<l>&quot;O gentle father, turn around and see-</l>
		<l>I will be left alone unless you halt.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;My son,&quot; he said, &quot;draw yourself up to there,&quot;</l>
		<l>while pointing to a somewhat higher terrace,</l>
		<l>which circles all the slope along that side.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His words incited me; my body tried;</l>
		<l>on hands and knees I scrambled after him</l>
		<l>until the terrace lay beneath my feet.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There we sat down together, facing east,</l>
		<l>in the direction from which we had come:</l>
		<l>what joy-to look back at a path we&apos;ve climbed!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My eyes were first set on the shores below,</l>
		<l>and then I raised them toward the sun; I was</l>
		<l>amazed to find it fall upon our left.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And when the poet saw that I was struck</l>
		<l>with wonder as I watched the chariot</l>
		<l>of light passing between the north and us,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he said to me: &quot;Suppose Castor and Pollux</l>
		<l>were in conjunction with that mirror there,</l>
		<l>which takes the light and guides it north and sout</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>then you would see the reddish zodiac</l>
		<l>still closer to the Bears as it revolves-</l>
		<l>unless it has abandoned its old track.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If you would realize how that should be,</l>
		<l>then concentrate, imagining this mountain</l>
		<l>so placed upon this earth that both Mount Zions&#xec;,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and it, although in different hemispheres,</l>
		<l>share one horizon; therefore, you can see,</l>
		<l>putting your mind to it attentively,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>how that same path which Phaethon drove so poorly</l>
		<l>must pass this mountain on the north, whereas</l>
		<l>it skirts Mount Zion on the southern side.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I said: &quot;My master, surely I have never-</l>
		<l>since my intelligence seemed lacking-seen</l>
		<l>as clearly as I now can comprehend,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that the mid-circle of the heavens&apos; motion</l>
		<l>(one of the sciences calls it Equator),</l>
		<l>which always lies between the sun and winter,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>as you explained, lies as far north of here</l>
		<l>as it lies southward of the site from which</l>
		<l>the Hebrews, looking toward the tropics, saw it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But if it please you, I should willingly</l>
		<l>learn just how far it is we still must journey:</l>
		<l>the slope climbs higher than my eyes can follow.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;This mountain&apos;s of such sort</l>
		<l>that climbing it is hardest at the start;</l>
		<l>but as we rise, the slope grows less unkind.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Therefore, when this slope seems to you so gentle</l>
		<l>that climbing farther up will be as restful</l>
		<l>as traveling downstream by boat, you will</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>be where this pathway ends, and there you can</l>
		<l>expect to put your weariness to rest.</l>
		<l>I say no more, and this I know as truth.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And when his words were done, another voice</l>
		<l>nearby was heard to say: &quot;Perhaps you will</l>
		<l>have need to sit before you reach that point!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Hearing that voice, both of us turned around,</l>
		<l>and to the left we saw a massive boulder,</l>
		<l>which neither he nor I-before-had noticed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We made our way toward it and toward the people</l>
		<l>who lounged behind that boulder in the shade,</l>
		<l>as men beset by listlessness will rest.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And one of them, who seemed to me exhausted,</l>
		<l>was sitting with his arms around his knees;</l>
		<l>between his knees, he kept his head bent down.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O my sweet lord,&quot; I said, &quot;look carefully</l>
		<l>at one who shows himself more languid than</l>
		<l>he would have been were laziness his sister!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then that shade turned toward us attentively,</l>
		<l>lifting his eyes, but just above his thigh,</l>
		<l>and said: &quot;Climb, then, if you&apos;re so vigorous!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I knew who he was, and the distress</l>
		<l>that still was quickening my breath somewhat,</l>
		<l>did not prevent my going to him; and</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when I had reached him, scarcely lifting up</l>
		<l>his head, he said: &quot;And have you fathomed how</l>
		<l>the sun can drive his chariot on your left?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The slowness of his movements, his brief words</l>
		<l>had stirred my lips a little toward a smile;</l>
		<l>then I began: &quot;From this time on, Belacqua,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I need not grieve for you; but tell me, why</l>
		<l>do you sit here? Do you expect a guide?</l>
		<l>Or have you fallen into your old ways?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he: &quot;O brother, what&apos;s the use of climbing?</l>
		<l>God&apos;s angel, he who guards the gate, would not</l>
		<l>let me pass through to meet my punishment.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Outside that gate the skies must circle round</l>
		<l>as many times as they did when I lived-</l>
		<l>since I delayed good sighs until the end-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>unless, before then, I am helped by prayer</l>
		<l>that rises from a heart that lives in grace;</l>
		<l>what use are other prayers-ignored by Heaven?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And now the poet climbed ahead, before me,</l>
		<l>and said: &quot;It&apos;s time; see the meridian</l>
		<l>touched by the sun; elsewhere, along the Ocean,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>night now has set its foot upon Morocco.&quot;</l>
	</p>
