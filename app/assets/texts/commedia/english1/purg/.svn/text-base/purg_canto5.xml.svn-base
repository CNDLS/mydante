		<l>I had already left those shades behind</l>
		<l>and followed in the footsteps of my guide</l>
		<l>when, there beneath me, pointing at me, one</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>shade shouted: &quot;See the second climber climb:</l>
		<l>the sun seems not to shine on his left side</l>
		<l>and when he walks, he walks like one alive!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When I had heard these words, I turned my eyes</l>
		<l>and saw the shades astonished as they stared</l>
		<l>at me-at me, and at the broken light.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Why have you let your mind get so entwined,&quot;</l>
		<l>my master said, &quot;that you have slowed your walk?</l>
		<l>Why should you care about what&apos;s whispered here?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Come, follow me, and let these people talk:</l>
		<l>stand like a sturdy tower that does not shake</l>
		<l>its summit though the winds may blast; always</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the man in whom thought thrusts ahead of thought</l>
		<l>allows the goal he&apos;s set to move far off-</l>
		<l>the force of one thought saps the other&apos;s force.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Could my reply be other than &quot;I come&quot;?</l>
		<l>And-somewhat colored by the hue that makes</l>
		<l>one sometimes merit grace-I spoke those words.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Meanwhile, along the slope, crossing our road</l>
		<l>slightly ahead of us, people approached,</l>
		<l>singing the Miserere verse by verse.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When they became aware that I allowed</l>
		<l>no path for rays of light to cross my body,</l>
		<l>they changed their song into a long, hoarse &quot;Oh!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And two of them, serving as messengers,</l>
		<l>hurried to meet us, and those two inquired:</l>
		<l>&quot;Please tell us something more of what you are.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My master answered them: &quot;You can return</l>
		<l>and carry this report to those who sent you:</l>
		<l>in truth, the body of this man is flesh.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If, as I think, they stopped to see his shadow,</l>
		<l>that answer is sufficient: let them welcome</l>
		<l>him graciously, and that may profit them.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Never did I see kindled vapors rend</l>
		<l>clear skies at nightfall or the setting sun</l>
		<l>cleave August clouds with a rapidity</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that matched the time it took those two to speed</l>
		<l>above; and, there arrived, they with the others</l>
		<l>wheeled back, like ranks that run without a rein.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;These people pressing in on us are many;</l>
		<l>they come beseeching you,&quot; the poet said;</l>
		<l>&quot;don&apos;t stop, but listen as you move ahead.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O soul who make your way to gladness with</l>
		<l>the limbs you had at birth, do stay your steps</l>
		<l>awhile,&quot; they clamored as they came, &quot;to see</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>if there is any of us whom you knew,</l>
		<l>that you may carry word of him beyond.</l>
		<l>Why do you hurry on? Why don&apos;t you stop?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We all were done to death by violence,</l>
		<l>and we all sinned until our final hour;</l>
		<l>then light from Heaven granted understanding,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so that, repenting and forgiving, we</l>
		<l>came forth from life at peace with God, and He</l>
		<l>instilled in us the longing to see Him.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I: &quot;Although I scrutinize your faces,</l>
		<l>I recognize no one; but, spirits born</l>
		<l>to goodness, if there&apos;s anything within</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>my power that might please you, then-by that</l>
		<l>same peace which in the steps of such a guide</l>
		<l>I seek from world to world-I shall perform it.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And one began: &quot;We all have faith in your</l>
		<l>good offices without your oath, as long</l>
		<l>as lack of power does not curb your will.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus I, who speak alone-before the others-</l>
		<l>beseech you, if you ever see the land</l>
		<l>that lies between Romagna and the realm</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of Charles, that you be courteous to me,</l>
		<l>entreating those in Fano to bestow</l>
		<l>fair prayers to purge me of my heavy sins.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My home was Fano; but the piercing wounds</l>
		<l>from which there poured the blood where my life lived--</l>
		<l>those I received among Antenor&apos;s sons,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>there where I thought that I was most secure;</l>
		<l>for he of Este, hating me far more</l>
		<l>than justice warranted, had that deed done.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But had I fled instead toward Mira when</l>
		<l>they overtook me at Oriaco, then</l>
		<l>I should still be beyond, where men draw breath.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I hurried to the marsh. The mud, the reeds</l>
		<l>entangled me; I fell. And there I saw</l>
		<l>a pool, poured from my veins, form on the ground.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Another shade then said: &quot;Ah, so may that</l>
		<l>desire which draws you up the lofty mountain</l>
		<l>be granted, with kind pity help my longing!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I was from Montefeltro, I&apos;m Buonconte;</l>
		<l>Giovanna and the rest-they all neglect me;</l>
		<l>therefore, among these shades, I go in sadness.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I to him: &quot;What violence or chance</l>
		<l>so dragged you from the field of Campaldino</l>
		<l>that we know nothing of your burial place?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Oh,&quot; he replied, &quot;across the Casentino</l>
		<l>there runs a stream called Archiano-born</l>
		<l>in the Apennines above the Hermitage.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There, at the place where that stream&apos;s name is lost,s</l>
		<l>I came-my throat was pierced-fleeing on foot</l>
		<l>and bloodying the plain; and there it was</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that I lost sight and speech; and there, as I</l>
		<l>had finished uttering the name of Mary,</l>
		<l>I fell; and there my flesh alone remained.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I&apos;ll speak the truth-do you, among the living,</l>
		<l>retell it: I was taken by God&apos;s angel,</l>
		<l>but he from Hell cried: &apos;You from Heaven-why</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>do you deny me him? For just one tear</l>
		<l>you carry off his deathless part; but I</l>
		<l>shall treat his other part in other wise.&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You are aware how, in the air, moist vapor</l>
		<l>will gather and again revert to rain</l>
		<l>as soon as it has climbed where cold enfolds.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His evil will, which only seeks out evil,</l>
		<l>conjoined with intellect; and with the power</l>
		<l>his nature grants, he stirred up wind and vapor.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then, when day was done, he filled the valley</l>
		<l>from Pratomagno far as the great ridge</l>
		<l>with mist; the sky above was saturated</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The dense air was converted into water;</l>
		<l>rain fell, and then the gullies had to carry</l>
		<l>whatever water earth could not receive;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and when that rain was gathered into torrents,</l>
		<l>it rushed so swiftly toward the royal river</l>
		<l>that nothing could contain its turbulence.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The angry Archiano-at its mouth-</l>
		<l>had found my frozen body; and it thrust</l>
		<l>it in the Arno and set loose the cross</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that, on my chest, my arms, in pain, had formed</l>
		<l>It rolled me on the banks and river bed,</l>
		<l>then covered, girded me with its debris.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Pray, after your returning to the world,</l>
		<l>when, after your long journeying, you&apos;ve rested,&quot;</l>
		<l>the third soul, following the second, said,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;may you remember me, who am La Pia;</l>
		<l>Siena made-Maremma unmade-me:</l>
		<l>he who, when we were wed, gave me his pledge</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and then, as nuptial ring, his gem, knows that.&quot;</l>
	</p>
