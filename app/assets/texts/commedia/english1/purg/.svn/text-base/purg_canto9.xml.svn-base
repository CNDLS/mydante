	<p>
		<l>Now she who shares the bed of old Tithonus,</l>
		<l>abandoning the arms of her sweet lover,</l>
		<l>grew white along the eastern balcony;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the heavens facing her were glittering</l>
		<l>with gems set in the semblance of the chill</l>
		<l>animal that assails men with its tail;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>while night within the valley where we were</l>
		<l>had moved across two of the steps it climbs,</l>
		<l>and now the third step made night&apos;s wings incline;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when I, who bore something of Adam with me,</l>
		<l>feeling the need for sleep, lay down upon</l>
		<l>the grass where now all five of us were seated.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At that hour close to morning when the swallow</l>
		<l>begins her melancholy songs, perhaps</l>
		<l>in memory of her ancient sufferings,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when, free to wander farther from the flesh</l>
		<l>and less held fast by cares, our intellect&apos;s</l>
		<l>envisionings become almost divine-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>in dream I seemed to see an eagle poised,</l>
		<l>with golden pinions, in the sky: its wings</l>
		<l>were open; it was ready to swoop down.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I seemed to be there where Ganymede</l>
		<l>deserted his own family when he</l>
		<l>was snatched up for the high consistory.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Within myself I thought: &quot;This eagle may</l>
		<l>be used to hunting only here; its claws</l>
		<l>refuse to carry upward any prey</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>found elsewhere.&quot; Then it seemed to me that, wheel</l>
		<l>slightly and terrible as lightning, it</l>
		<l>swooped, snatching me up to the fire&apos;s orbit.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And there it seemed that he and I were burning;</l>
		<l>and this imagined conflagration scorched</l>
		<l>me so-I was compelled to break my sleep.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just like the waking of Achilles when</l>
		<l>he started up, casting his eyes about him,</l>
		<l>not knowing where he was (after his mother</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>had stolen him, asleep, away from Chiron</l>
		<l>and in her arms had carried him to Skyros,</l>
		<l>the isle the Greeks would-later-make him leave);</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>such was my starting up, as soon as sleep</l>
		<l>had left my eyes, and I went pale, as will</l>
		<l>a man who, terrified, turns cold as ice.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The only one beside me was my comfort;</l>
		<l>by now the sun was more than two hours high;</l>
		<l>it was the sea to which I turned my eyes.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My lord said: &quot;Have no fear; be confident,</l>
		<l>for we are well along our way; do not</l>
		<l>restrain, but give free rein to, all your strength</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You have already come to Purgatory:</l>
		<l>see there the rampart wall enclosing it;</l>
		<l>see, where that wall is breached, the point of ent</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Before, at dawn that ushers in the day,</l>
		<l>when soul was sleeping in your body, on</l>
		<l>the flowers that adorn the ground below,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>a lady came; she said: &apos;I am Lucia;</l>
		<l>let me take hold of him who is asleep,</l>
		<l>that I may help to speed him on his way.&apos;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Sordello and the other noble spirits</l>
		<l>stayed there; and she took you, and once the day</l>
		<l>was bright, she climbed-I following behind.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And here she set you down, but first her lovely</l>
		<l>eyes showed that open entryway to me;</l>
		<l>then she and sleep together took their leave.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just like a man in doubt who then grows sure,</l>
		<l>exchanging fear for confidence, once truth</l>
		<l>has been revealed to him, so was I changed;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and when my guide had seen that I was free</l>
		<l>from hesitation, then he moved, with me</l>
		<l>behind him, up the rocks and toward the heights.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Reader, you can see clearly how I lift</l>
		<l>my matter; do not wonder, therefore, if</l>
		<l>I have to call on more art to sustain it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now we were drawing closer; we had reached</l>
		<l>the part from which-where first I&apos;d seen a breach,</l>
		<l>precisely like a gap that cleaves a wall-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I now made out a gate and, there below it,</l>
		<l>three steps-their colors different-leading to it,</l>
		<l>and a custodian who had not yet spoken.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As I looked more and more directly at him,</l>
		<l>I saw him seated on the upper step-</l>
		<l>his face so radiant, I could not bear it;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and in his hand he held a naked sword,</l>
		<l>which so reflected rays toward us that I,</l>
		<l>time and again, tried to sustain that sight</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>in vain. &quot;Speak out from there; what are you seeking?&quot;</l>
		<l>so he began to speak. &quot;Where is your escort?</l>
		<l>Take care lest you be harmed by climbing here.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My master answered him: &quot;But just before,</l>
		<l>a lady came from Heaven and, familiar</l>
		<l>with these things, told us: &apos;That&apos;s the gate; go there.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;And may she speed you on your path of goodness!&quot;</l>
		<l>the gracious guardian of the gate began</l>
		<l>again. &quot;Come forward, therefore, to our stairs.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There we approached, and the first step was white</l>
		<l>marble, so polished and so clear that I</l>
		<l>was mirrored there as I appear in life.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The second step, made out of crumbling rock,</l>
		<l>rough-textured, scorched, with cracks that ran across</l>
		<l>its length and width, was darker than deep purple.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The third, resting above more massively,</l>
		<l>appeared to me to be of porphyry,</l>
		<l>as flaming red as blood that spurts from veins.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And on this upper step, God&apos;s angel-seated</l>
		<l>upon the threshold, which appeared to me</l>
		<l>to be of adamant-kept his feet planted.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My guide, with much good will, had me ascend</l>
		<l>by way of these three steps, enjoining me:</l>
		<l>&quot;Do ask him humbly to unbolt the gate.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I threw myself devoutly at his holy</l>
		<l>feet, asking him to open out of mercy;</l>
		<l>but first I beat three times upon my breast.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Upon my forehead, he traced seven P&apos;s</l>
		<l>with his sword&apos;s point and said: &quot;When you have entered</l>
		<l>within, take care to wash away these wounds.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Ashes, or dry earth that has just been quarried,</l>
		<l>would share one color with his robe, and from</l>
		<l>beneath that robe he drew two keys; the one</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>was made of gold, the other was of silver;</l>
		<l>first with the white, then with the yellow key,</l>
		<l>he plied the gate so as to satisfy me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Whenever one of these keys fails, not turning</l>
		<l>appropriately in the lock,&quot; he said</l>
		<l>to us, &quot;this gate of entry does not open.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>One is more precious, but the other needs</l>
		<l>much art and skill before it will unlock-</l>
		<l>that is the key that must undo the knot.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These I received from Peter; and he taught me</l>
		<l>rather to err in opening than in keeping</l>
		<l>this portal shut-whenever souls pray humbly.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then he pushed back the panels of the holy</l>
		<l>gate, saying: &quot;Enter; but I warn you-he</l>
		<l>who would look back, returns-again-outside.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And when the panels of that sacred portal,</l>
		<l>which are of massive and resounding metal,</l>
		<l>turned in their hinges, then even Tarpeia</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>(when good Metellus was removed from it,</l>
		<l>for which that rock was left impoverished)</l>
		<l>did not roar so nor show itself so stubborn.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Hearing that gate resound, I turned, attentive;</l>
		<l>I seemed to hear, inside, in words that mingled</l>
		<l>with gentle music, &quot; Te Deum laudamus.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And what I heard gave me the very same</l>
		<l>impression one is used to getting when</l>
		<l>one hears a song accompanied by organ,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and now the words are clear and now are lost.</l>
