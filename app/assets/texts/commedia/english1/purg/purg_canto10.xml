		<l>When I had crossed the threshold of the gate</l>
		<l>that-since the soul&apos;s aberrant love would make</l>
		<l>the crooked way seem straight-is seldom used,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I heard the gate resound and, hearing, knew</l>
		<l>that it had shut; and if I&apos;d turned toward it,</l>
		<l>how could my fault have found a fit excuse?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Our upward pathway ran between cracked rocks;</l>
		<l>they seemed to sway in one, then the other part,</l>
		<l>just like a wave that flees, then doubles back.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Here we shall need some ingenuity,&quot;</l>
		<l>my guide warned me, &quot;as both of us draw near</l>
		<l>this side or that side where the rock wall veers.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This made our steps so slow and hesitant</l>
		<l>that the declining moon had reached its bed</l>
		<l>to sink back into rest, before we had</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>made our way through that needle&apos;s eye; but when</l>
		<l>we were released from it, in open space</l>
		<l>above, a place at which the slope retreats,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I was exhausted; with the two of us</l>
		<l>uncertain of our way, we halted on</l>
		<l>a plateau lonelier than desert paths.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The distance from its edge, which rims the void,</l>
		<l>in to the base of the steep slope, which climbs</l>
		<l>and climbs, would measure three times one man&apos;s body;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and for as far as my sight took its flight,</l>
		<l>now to the left, now to the right-hand side,</l>
		<l>that terrace seemed to me equally wide.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There we had yet to let our feet advance</l>
		<l>when I discovered that the bordering bank-</l>
		<l>less sheer than banks of other terraces-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>was of white marble and adorned with carvings</l>
		<l>so accurate-not only Polycletus</l>
		<l>but even Nature, there, would feel defeated.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The angel who reached earth with the decree</l>
		<l>of that peace which, for many years, had been</l>
		<l>invoked with tears, the peace that opened Heaven</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>after long interdict, appeared before us,</l>
		<l>his gracious action carved with such precision-</l>
		<l>he did not seem to be a silent image.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>One would have sworn that he was saying, &quot;Ave&quot;;</l>
		<l>for in that scene there was the effigy</l>
		<l>of one who turned the key that had unlocked</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the highest love; and in her stance there were</l>
		<l>impressed these words, &quot;Ecce ancilla Dei,&quot;</l>
		<l>precisely like a figure stamped in wax.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Your mind must not attend to just one part,&quot;</l>
		<l>the gentle master said-he had me on</l>
		<l>the side of him where people have their heart.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this, I turned my face and saw beyond</l>
		<l>the form of Mary-on the side where stood</l>
		<l>the one who guided me-another story</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>engraved upon the rock; therefore I moved</l>
		<l>past Virgil and drew close to it, so that</l>
		<l>the scene before my eyes was more distinct.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There, carved in that same marble, were the cart</l>
		<l>and oxen as they drew the sacred ark,</l>
		<l>which makes men now fear tasks not in their charge</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>People were shown in front; and all that group,</l>
		<l>divided into seven choirs, made</l>
		<l>two of my senses speak-one sense said, &quot;No,&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the other said, &quot;Yes, they do sing&quot;; just so,</l>
		<l>about the incense smoke shown there, my nose</l>
		<l>and eyes contended, too, with yes and no.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And there the humble psalmist went before</l>
		<l>the sacred vessel, dancing, lifting up</l>
		<l>his robe-he was both less and more than king.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Facing that scene, and shown as at the window</l>
		<l>of a great palace, Michal watched as would</l>
		<l>a woman full of scorn and suffering.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>To look more closely at another carving,</l>
		<l>which I saw gleaming white beyond Michal,</l>
		<l>my feet moved past the point where I had stood.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And there the noble action of a Roman</l>
		<l>prince was presented-he whose worth had urged</l>
		<l>on Gregory to his great victory-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I mean the Emperor Trajan; and a poor</l>
		<l>widow was near his bridle, and she stood</l>
		<l>even as one in tears and sadness would.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Around him, horsemen seemed to press and crowd;</l>
		<l>above their heads, on golden banners, eagles</l>
		<l>were represented, moving in the wind.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Among that crowd, the miserable woman</l>
		<l>seemed to be saying: &quot;Lord, avenge me for</l>
		<l>the slaying of my son-my heart is broken.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he was answering: &quot;Wait now until</l>
		<l>I have returned.&quot; And she, as one in whom</l>
		<l>grief presses urgently: &quot;And, lord, if you</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>do not return?&quot; And he: &quot;The one who&apos;ll be</l>
		<l>in my place will perform it for you.&quot; She:</l>
		<l>&quot;What good can others&apos; goodness do for you</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>if you neglect your own?&quot; He: &quot;Be consoled;</l>
		<l>my duty shall be done before I go:</l>
		<l>so justice asks, so mercy makes me stay.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This was the speech made visible by One</l>
		<l>within whose sight no thing is new-but we,</l>
		<l>who lack its likeness here, find novelty.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>While I took much delight in witnessing</l>
		<l>these effigies of true humility-</l>
		<l>dear, too, to see because He was their Maker-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the poet murmured: &quot;See the multitude</l>
		<l>advancing, though with slow steps, on this side:</l>
		<l>they will direct us to the higher stairs.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My eyes, which had been satisfied in seeking</l>
		<l>new sights-a thing for which they long-did not</l>
		<l>delay in turning toward him. But I would</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>not have you, reader, be deflected from</l>
		<l>your good resolve by hearing from me now</l>
		<l>how God would have us pay the debt we owe.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Don&apos;t dwell upon the form of punishment:</l>
		<l>consider what comes after that; at worst</l>
		<l>it cannot last beyond the final Judgment.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Master,&quot; I said, &quot;what I see moving toward us</l>
		<l>does not appear to me like people, but</l>
		<l>I can&apos;t tell what is there-my sight&apos;s bewildered.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;Whatever makes them suffer</l>
		<l>their heavy torment bends them to the ground;</l>
		<l>at first I was unsure of what they were.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But look intently there, and let your eyes</l>
		<l>unravel what&apos;s beneath those stones: you can</l>
		<l>already see what penalty strikes each.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O Christians, arrogant, exhausted, wretched,</l>
		<l>whose intellects are sick and cannot see,</l>
		<l>who place your confidence in backward steps,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>do you not know that we are worms and born</l>
		<l>to form the angelic butterfly that soars,</l>
		<l>without defenses, to confront His judgment?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Why does your mind presume to flight when you</l>
		<l>are still like the imperfect grub, the worm</l>
		<l>before it has attained its final form?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as one sees at times-as corbel for</l>
		<l>support of ceiling or of roof-a figure</l>
		<l>with knees drawn up into its chest (and this</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>oppressiveness, unreal, gives rise to real</l>
		<l>distress in him who watches it): such was</l>
		<l>the state of those I saw when I looked hard.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>They were indeed bent down-some less, some more-</l>
		<l>according to the weights their backs now bore;</l>
		<l>and even he whose aspect showed most patience,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>in tears, appeared to say: &quot;I can no more.&quot;</l>
	</p>
