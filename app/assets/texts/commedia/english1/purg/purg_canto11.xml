	<p>
		<l>&quot;Our Father, You who dwell within the heavens-</l>
		<l>but are not circumscribed by them-out of</l>
		<l>Your greater love for Your first works above,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>praised be Your name and Your omnipotence,</l>
		<l>by every creature, just as it is seemly</l>
		<l>to offer thanks to Your sweet effluence.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Your kingdom&apos;s peace come unto us, for if</l>
		<l>it does not come, then though we summon all</l>
		<l>our force, we cannot reach it of our selves.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as Your angels, as they sing Hosanna,</l>
		<l>offer their wills to You as sacrifice,</l>
		<l>so may men offer up their wills to You.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Give unto us this day the daily manna</l>
		<l>without which he who labors most to move</l>
		<l>ahead through this harsh wilderness falls back.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even as we forgive all who have done</l>
		<l>us injury, may You, benevolent,</l>
		<l>forgive, and do not judge us by our worth.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Try not our strength, so easily subdued,</l>
		<l>against the ancient foe, but set it free</l>
		<l>from him who goads it to perversity.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This last request we now address to You,</l>
		<l>dear Lord, not for ourselves-who have no need-</l>
		<l>but for the ones whom we have left behind.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Beseeching, thus, good penitence for us</l>
		<l>and for themselves, those shades moved on beneath</l>
		<l>their weights, like those we sometimes bear in dreams--</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>each in his own degree of suffering</l>
		<l>but all, exhausted, circling the first terrace,</l>
		<l>purging themselves of this world&apos;s scoriae.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If there they pray on our behalf, what can</l>
		<l>be said and done here on this earth for them</l>
		<l>by those whose wills are rooted in true worth?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Indeed we should help them to wash away</l>
		<l>the stains they carried from this world, so that,</l>
		<l>made pure and light, they reach the starry wheels.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Ah, so may justice and compassion soon</l>
		<l>unburden you, so that your wings may move</l>
		<l>as you desire them to, and uplift you,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>show us on which hand lies the shortest path</l>
		<l>to reach the stairs; if there is more than one</l>
		<l>passage, then show us that which is less steep;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for he who comes with me, because he wears</l>
		<l>the weight of Adam&apos;s flesh as dress, despite</l>
		<l>his ready will, is slow in his ascent.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>These words, which had been spoken by my guide,</l>
		<l>were answered by still other words we heard;</l>
		<l>for though it was not clear who had replied,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>an answer came: &quot;Come with us to the right</l>
		<l>along the wall of rock, and you will find</l>
		<l>a pass where even one alive can climb.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And were I not impeded by the stone</l>
		<l>that, since it has subdued my haughty neck,</l>
		<l>compels my eyes to look below, then I</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>should look at this man who is still alive</l>
		<l>and nameless, to see if I recognize</l>
		<l>him-and to move his pity for my burden.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I was Italian, son of a great Tuscan:</l>
		<l>my father was Guiglielmo Aldobrandesco;</l>
		<l>I do not know if you have heard his name.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The ancient blood and splendid deeds of my</l>
		<l>forefathers made me so presumptuous</l>
		<l>that, without thinking on our common mother,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I scorned all men past measure, and that scorn</l>
		<l>brought me my death-the Sienese know how,</l>
		<l>as does each child in Campagnatico.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I am Omberto; and my arrogance</l>
		<l>has not harmed me alone, for it has drawn</l>
		<l>all of my kin into calamity.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Until God has been satisfied, I bear</l>
		<l>this burden here among the dead because</l>
		<l>I did not bear this load among the living.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My face was lowered as I listened; and</l>
		<l>one of those souls-not he who&apos;d spoken-twisted</l>
		<l>himself beneath the weight that burdened them;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he saw and knew me and called out to me,</l>
		<l>fixing his eyes on me laboriously</l>
		<l>as I, completely hunched, walked on with them.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Oh,&quot; I cried out, &quot;are you not Oderisi,</l>
		<l>glory of Gubbio, glory of that art</l>
		<l>they call illumination now in Paris?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Brother,&quot; he said, &quot;the pages painted by</l>
		<l>the brush of Franco Bolognese smile</l>
		<l>more brightly: all the glory now is his;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>mine, but a part. In truth I would have been</l>
		<l>less gracious when I lived-so great was that</l>
		<l>desire for eminence which drove my heart.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For such pride, here one pays the penalty;</l>
		<l>and I&apos;d not be here yet, had it not been</l>
		<l>that, while I still could sin, I turned to Him.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>O empty glory of the powers of humans!</l>
		<l>How briefly green endures upon the peak-</l>
		<l>unless an age of dullness follows it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>In painting Cimabue thought he held</l>
		<l>the field, and now it&apos;s Giotto they acclaim-</l>
		<l>the former only keeps a shadowed fame.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So did one Guido, from the other, wrest</l>
		<l>the glory of our tongue-and he perhaps</l>
		<l>is born who will chase both out of the nest.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Worldly renown is nothing other than</l>
		<l>a breath of wind that blows now here, now there,</l>
		<l>and changes name when it has changed its course.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Before a thousand years have passed-a span</l>
		<l>that, for eternity, is less space than</l>
		<l>an eyeblink for the slowest sphere in heaven-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>would you find greater glory if you left</l>
		<l>your flesh when it was old than if your death</l>
		<l>had come before your infant words were spent?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>All Tuscany acclaimed his name-the man</l>
		<l>who moves so slowly on the path before me,</l>
		<l>and now they scarcely whisper of him even</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>in Siena, where he lorded it when they</l>
		<l>destroyed the raging mob of Florence-then</l>
		<l>as arrogant as now it&apos;s prostitute.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Your glory wears the color of the grass</l>
		<l>that comes and goes; the sun that makes it wither</l>
		<l>first drew it from the ground, still green and ten</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I to him: &quot;Your truthful speech has filled</l>
		<l>my soul with sound humility, abating</l>
		<l>my overswollen pride; but who is he</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of whom you spoke now?&quot; &quot;Provenzan Salvani,</l>
		<l>he answered, &quot;here because-presumptuously-&quot;</l>
		<l>he thought his grip could master all Siena.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So he has gone, and so he goes, with no</l>
		<l>rest since his death; this is the penalty</l>
		<l>exacted from those who-there-overreached.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I: &quot;But if a spirit who awaits</l>
		<l>the edge of life before repenting must-</l>
		<l>unless good prayers help him-stay below</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and not ascend here for as long a time</l>
		<l>as he had spent alive, do tell me how</l>
		<l>Salvani&apos;s entry here has been allowed.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;When he was living in his greatest glory&quot;</l>
		<l>said he, &quot;then of his own free will he set</l>
		<l>aside all shame and took his place upon</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the Campo of Siena; there, to free</l>
		<l>his friend from suffering in Charles&apos;s prison,</l>
		<l>humbling himself, he trembled in each vein.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I say no more; I know I speak obscurely;</l>
		<l>but soon enough you&apos;ll find your neighbor&apos;s acts</l>
		<l>are such that what I say can be explained.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This deed delivered him from those confines.&quot;</l>
	</p>
