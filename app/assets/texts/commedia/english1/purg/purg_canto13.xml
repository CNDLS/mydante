	<p>
		<l>We now had reached the summit of the stairs</l>
		<l>where once again the mountain whose ascent</l>
		<l>delivers man from sin has been indented.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There, just as in the case of the first terrace,</l>
		<l>a second terrace runs around the slope,</l>
		<l>except that it describes a sharper arc.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No effigy is there and no outline:</l>
		<l>the bank is visible, the naked path-</l>
		<l>only the livid color of raw rock.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;If we wait here in order to inquire</l>
		<l>of those who pass,&quot; the poet said, &quot;I fear</l>
		<l>our choice of path may be delayed too long.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then he fixed his eyes upon the sun;</l>
		<l>letting his right side serve to guide his movement</l>
		<l>he wheeled his left around and changed direction.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O gentle light, through trust in which I enter</l>
		<l>on this new path, may you conduct us here,&quot;</l>
		<l>he said, &quot;for men need guidance in this place.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You warm the world and you illumine it;</l>
		<l>unless a higher Power urge us elsewhere,</l>
		<l>your rays must always be the guides that lead.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We had already journeyed there as far</l>
		<l>as we should reckon here to be a mile,</l>
		<l>and done it in brief time-our will was eager-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when we heard spirits as they flew toward us,</l>
		<l>though they could not be seen-spirits pronouncing</l>
		<l>courteous invitations to love&apos;s table.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The first voice that flew by called out aloud:</l>
		<l>&quot;Vinum non habent,&quot; and behind us that</l>
		<l>same voice reiterated its example.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And as that voice drew farther off, before</l>
		<l>it faded finally, another cried:</l>
		<l>&quot;I am Orestes.&quot; It, too, did not stop.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;What voices are these, father?&quot; were my words;</l>
		<l>and as I asked him this, I heard a third</l>
		<l>voice say: &quot;Love those by whom you have been hurt.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And my good master said: &quot;The sin of envy</l>
		<l>is scourged within this circle; thus, the cords</l>
		<l>that form the scourging lash are plied by love.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The sounds of punished envy, envy curbed,</l>
		<l>are different; if I judge right, you&apos;ll hear</l>
		<l>those sounds before we reach the pass of pardon.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But let your eyes be fixed attentively</l>
		<l>and, through the air, you will see people seated</l>
		<l>before us, all of them on the stone terrace.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I opened-wider than before-my eyes;</l>
		<l>I looked ahead of me, and I saw shades</l>
		<l>with cloaks that shared their color with the rocks</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And once we&apos;d moved a little farther on,</l>
		<l>I heard the cry of, &quot;Mary, pray for us,&quot;</l>
		<l>and then heard, &quot;Michael,&quot; &quot;Peter,&quot; and &quot;All saint</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I think no man now walks upon the earth</l>
		<l>who is so hard that he would not have been</l>
		<l>pierced by compassion for what I saw next;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for when I had drawn close enough to see</l>
		<l>clearly the way they paid their penalty,</l>
		<l>the force of grief pressed tears out of my eyes.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Those souls-it seemed-were cloaked in coarse haircloth</l>
		<l>another&apos;s shoulder served each shade as prop,</l>
		<l>and all of them were bolstered by the rocks:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so do the blind who have to beg appear</l>
		<l>on pardon days to plead for what they need,</l>
		<l>each bending his head back and toward the other,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that all who watch feel-quickly-pity&apos;s touch</l>
		<l>not only through the words that would entreat</l>
		<l>but through the sight, which can-no less-beseech.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And just as, to the blind, no sun appears,</l>
		<l>so to the shades-of whom I now speak-here,</l>
		<l>the light of heaven would not give itself;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for iron wire pierces and sews up</l>
		<l>the lids of all those shades, as untamed hawks</l>
		<l>are handled, lest, too restless, they fly off.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It seemed to me a gross discourtesy</l>
		<l>for me, going, to see and not be seen;</l>
		<l>therefore, I turned to my wise counselor.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He knew quite well what I, though mute, had meant;</l>
		<l>and thus he did not wait for my request,</l>
		<l>but said: &quot;Speak, and be brief and to the point.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Virgil was to my right, along the outside,</l>
		<l>nearer the terrace-edge-no parapet</l>
		<l>was there to keep a man from falling off;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and to my other side were the devout</l>
		<l>shades; through their eyes, sewn so atrociously,</l>
		<l>those spirits forced the tears that bathed their cheeks.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I turned to them; and &quot;You who can be certain,&quot;</l>
		<l>I then began, &quot;of seeing that high light</l>
		<l>which is the only object of your longing,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>may, in your conscience, all impurity</l>
		<l>soon be dissolved by grace, so that the stream</l>
		<l>of memory flow through it limpidly;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>tell me, for I shall welcome such dear words,</l>
		<l>if any soul among you is Italian;</l>
		<l>if I know that, then I-perhaps-can help him.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;My brother, each of us is citizen</l>
		<l>of one true city: what you meant to say</l>
		<l>was &apos;one who lived in Italy as pilgrim.&apos;&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My hearing placed the point from which this answer</l>
		<l>had come somewhat ahead of me; therefore,</l>
		<l>I made myself heard farther on; moving,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw one shade among the rest who looked</l>
		<l>expectant; and if any should ask how-</l>
		<l>its chin was lifted as a blind man&apos;s is.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Spirit,&quot; I said, &quot;who have subdued yourself</l>
		<l>that you may climb, if it is you who answered,</l>
		<l>then let me know you by your place or name.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;I was a Sienese,&quot; she answered, &quot;and</l>
		<l>with others here I mend my wicked life,</l>
		<l>weeping to Him that He grant us Himself.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I was not sapient, though I was called Sapia;</l>
		<l>and I rejoiced far more at others&apos; hurts</l>
		<l>than at my own good fortune. And lest you</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>should think I have deceived you, hear and judge</l>
		<l>if I was not, as I have told you, mad</l>
		<l>when my years&apos; arc had reached its downward part.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My fellow citizens were close to Colle,</l>
		<l>where they&apos;d joined battle with their enemies,</l>
		<l>and I prayed God for that which He had willed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There they were routed, beaten; they were reeling</l>
		<l>along the bitter paths of flight; and seeing</l>
		<l>that chase, I felt incomparable joy,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so that I lifted up my daring face</l>
		<l>and cried to God: &apos;Now I fear you no more!&apos;-</l>
		<l>as did the blackbird after brief fair weather.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I looked for peace with God at my life&apos;s end;</l>
		<l>the penalty I owe for sin would not</l>
		<l>be lessened now by penitence had not</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>one who was sorrowing for me because</l>
		<l>of charity in him-Pier Pettinaio-</l>
		<l>remembered me in his devout petitions.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But who are you, who question our condition</l>
		<l>as you move on, whose eyes-if I judge right-</l>
		<l>have not been sewn, who uses breath to speak?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;My eyes,&quot; I said, &quot;will be denied me here,</l>
		<l>but only briefly; the offense of envy</l>
		<l>was not committed often by their gaze.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I fear much more the punishment below;</l>
		<l>my soul is anxious, in suspense; already</l>
		<l>I feel the heavy weights of the first terrace.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And she: &quot;Who, then, led you up here among us,</l>
		<l>if you believe you will return below?&quot;</l>
		<l>And I: &quot;He who is with me and is silent.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I am alive; and therefore, chosen spirit,</l>
		<l>if you would have me move my mortal steps</l>
		<l>on your behalf, beyond, ask me for that.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Oh, this,&quot; she answered, &quot;is so strange a thing</l>
		<l>to hear: the sign is clear-you have God&apos;s love.</l>
		<l>Thus, help me sometimes with your prayers. I ask</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of you, by that which you desire most,</l>
		<l>if you should ever tread the Tuscan earth,</l>
		<l>to see my name restored among my kin.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You will see them among those vain ones who</l>
		<l>have put their trust in Talamone (their loss</l>
		<l>in hope will be more than Diana cost);</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but there the admirals will lose the most.&quot;</l>
