		<l>Darkness of Hell and of a night deprived</l>
		<l>of every planet, under meager skies,</l>
		<l>as overcast by clouds as sky can be,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>had never served to veil my eyes so thickly</l>
		<l>nor covered them with such rough-textured stuff</l>
		<l>as smoke that wrapped us there in Purgatory;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>my eyes could not endure remaining open;</l>
		<l>so that my faithful, knowledgeable escort</l>
		<l>drew closer as he offered me his shoulder.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as a blind man moves behind his guide,</l>
		<l>that he not stray or strike against some thing</l>
		<l>that may do damage to-or even kill-him,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so I moved through the bitter, filthy air,</l>
		<l>while listening to my guide, who kept repeating:</l>
		<l>&quot;Take care that you are not cut off from me.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But I heard voices, and each seemed to pray</l>
		<l>unto the Lamb of God, who takes away</l>
		<l>our sins, for peace and mercy. &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>was sung repeatedly as their exordium,</l>
		<l>words sung in such a way-in unison-</l>
		<l>that fullest concord seemed to be among them.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Master, are those whom I hear, spirits?&quot; I</l>
		<l>asked him. &quot;You have grasped rightly,&quot; he replied,</l>
		<l>&quot;and as they go they loose the knot of anger.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Then who are you whose body pierces through</l>
		<l>our smoke, who speak of us exactly like</l>
		<l>a man who uses months to measure time?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>A voice said this. On hearing it, my master</l>
		<l>turned round to me: &quot;Reply to him, then ask</l>
		<l>if this way leads us to the upward path.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I: &quot;O creature who-that you return</l>
		<l>fair unto Him who made you-cleanse yourself,</l>
		<l>you shall hear wonders if you follow me.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;I&apos;ll follow you as far as I&apos;m allowed,&quot;</l>
		<l>he answered, &quot;and if smoke won&apos;t let us see,</l>
		<l>hearing will serve instead to keep us linked.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then I began: &quot;With those same swaddling-bands</l>
		<l>that death unwinds I take my upward path:</l>
		<l>I have come here by way of Hell&apos;s exactions;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>since God&apos;s so gathered me into His grace</l>
		<l>that He would have me, in a manner most</l>
		<l>unusual for moderns, see His court,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>do not conceal from me who you once were,</l>
		<l>before your death, and tell me if I go</l>
		<l>straight to the pass; your words will be our escort."</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;I was a Lombard and I was called Marco;</l>
		<l>I knew the world&apos;s ways, and I loved those goods</l>
		<l>for which the bows of all men now grow slack.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The way you&apos;ve taken leads directly upward.&quot;</l>
		<l>So he replied, and then he added: &quot;I</l>
		<l>pray you to pray for me when you&apos;re above.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I to him: &quot;I pledge my faith to you</l>
		<l>to do what you have asked; and yet a doubt</l>
		<l>will burst in me if it finds no way out.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Before, my doubt was simple; but your statement</l>
		<l>has doubled it and made me sure that I</l>
		<l>am right to couple your words with another&apos;s.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The world indeed has been stripped utterly</l>
		<l>of every virtue; as you said to me,</l>
		<l>it cloaks-and is cloaked by-perversity.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Some place the cause in heaven, some, below;</l>
		<l>but I beseech you to define the cause,</l>
		<l>that, seeing it, I may show it to others.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>A sigh, from which his sorrow formed an &quot;Oh,&quot;</l>
		<l>was his beginning; then he answered: &quot;Brother,</l>
		<l>the world is blind, and you come from the world.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You living ones continue to assign</l>
		<l>to heaven every cause, as if it were</l>
		<l>the necessary source of every motion.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>If this were so, then your free will would be</l>
		<l>destroyed, and there would be no equity</l>
		<l>in joy for doing good, in grief for evil.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The heavens set your appetites in motion-</l>
		<l>not all your appetites, but even if</l>
		<l>that were the case, you have received both light</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>on good and evil, and free will, which though</l>
		<l>it struggle in its first wars with the heavens,</l>
		<l>then conquers all, if it has been well nurtured.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>On greater power and a better nature</l>
		<l>you, who are free, depend; that Force engenders</l>
		<l>the mind in you, outside the heavens&apos; sway.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus, if the present world has gone astray,</l>
		<l>in you is the cause, in you it&apos;s to be sought;</l>
		<l>and now I&apos;ll serve as your true exegete.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Issuing from His hands, the soul-on which</l>
		<l>He thought with love before creating it-</l>
		<l>is like a child who weeps and laughs in sport;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that soul is simple, unaware; but since</l>
		<l>a joyful Maker gave it motion, it</l>
		<l>turns willingly to things that bring delight.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At first it savors trivial goods; these would</l>
		<l>beguile the soul, and it runs after them,</l>
		<l>unless there&apos;s guide or rein to rule its love.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Therefore, one needed law to serve as curb;</l>
		<l>a ruler, too, was needed, one who could</l>
		<l>discern at least the tower of the true city.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The laws exist, but who applies them now?</l>
		<l>No one-the shepherd who precedes his flock</l>
		<l>can chew the cud but does not have cleft hooves;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and thus the people, who can see their guide</l>
		<l>snatch only at that good for which they feel</l>
		<l>some greed, would feed on that and seek no further</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Misrule, you see, has caused the world to be</l>
		<l>malevolent; the cause is clearly not</l>
		<l>celestial forces-they do not corrupt.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For Rome, which made the world good, used to have</l>
		<l>two suns; and they made visible two paths-</l>
		<l>the world&apos;s path and the pathway that is God&apos;s.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Each has eclipsed the other; now the sword</l>
		<l>has joined the shepherd&apos;s crook; the two together</l>
		<l>must of necessity result in evil,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>because, so joined, one need not fear the other:</l>
		<l>and if you doubt me, watch the fruit and flower,</l>
		<l>for every plant is known by what it seeds.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Within the territory watered by</l>
		<l>the Adige and Po, one used to find</l>
		<l>valor and courtesy-that is, before</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Frederick was met by strife; now anyone</l>
		<l>ashamed of talking with the righteous or</l>
		<l>of meeting them can journey there, secure.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>True, three old men are there, in whom old times</l>
		<l>reprove the new; and they find God is slow</l>
		<l>in summoning them to a better life:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Currado da Palazzo, good Gherardo,</l>
		<l>and Guido da Castel, whom it is better</l>
		<l>to call, as do the French, the candid Lombard.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You can conclude: the Church of Rome confounds</l>
		<l>two powers in itself; into the filth,</l>
		<l>it falls and fouls itself and its new burden.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Good Marco,&quot; I replied, &quot;you reason well;</l>
		<l>and now I understand why Levi&apos;s sons were</l>
		<l>not allowed to share in legacies.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But what Gherardo is this whom you mention</l>
		<l>as an example of the vanished people</l>
		<l>whose presence would reproach this savage age?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Either your speech deceives me or would tempt me,</l>
		<l>he answered then, &quot;for you, whose speech is Tuscan</l>
		<l>seem to know nothing of the good Gherardo.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There is no other name by which I know him,</l>
		<l>unless I speak of him as Gaia&apos;s father.</l>
		<l>God be with you; I come with you no farther.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You see the rays that penetrate the smoke</l>
		<l>already whitening; I must take leave-</l>
		<l>the angel has arrived-before he sees me.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So he turned back and would not hear me more.</l>
	</p>
