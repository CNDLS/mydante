		<l>Our talking did not slow our pace, our pace</l>
		<l>not slow our talking; but conversing, we</l>
		<l>moved quickly, like a boat a fair wind drives.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And recognizing that I was alive,</l>
		<l>the shades-they seemed to be things twice dead-dre</l>
		<l>amazement from the hollows of their eyes.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I, continuing my telling, added:</l>
		<l>&quot;Perhaps he is more slow in his ascent</l>
		<l>than he would be had he not met the other.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But tell me, if you can: where is Piccarda?</l>
		<l>And tell me if, among those staring at me,</l>
		<l>I can see any person I should note.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;My sister-and I know not whether she</l>
		<l>was greater in her goodness or her beauty-</l>
		<l>on high Olympus is in triumph; she</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>rejoices in her crown already,&quot; he</l>
		<l>began, then added: &quot;It is not forbidden</l>
		<l>to name each shade here-abstinence has eaten</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>away our faces.&quot; And he pointed: &quot;This</l>
		<l>is Bonagiunta, Bonagiunta da</l>
		<l>Lucca; the one beyond him, even more</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>emaciated than the rest, had clasped</l>
		<l>the Holy Church; he was from Tours; his fast</l>
		<l>purges Bolsena&apos;s eels, Vernaccia&apos;s wine.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he named many others, one by one,</l>
		<l>and, at their naming, they all seemed content;</l>
		<l>so that-for this-no face was overcast.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw-their teeth were biting emptiness-</l>
		<l>both Ubaldin da la Pila and Boniface,</l>
		<l>who shepherded so many with his staff.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw Messer Marchese, who once had</l>
		<l>more ease, less dryness, drinking at Forli</l>
		<l>and yet could never satisfy his thirst.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But just as he who looks and then esteems</l>
		<l>one more than others, so did I prize him</l>
		<l>of Lucca, for he seemed to know me better.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He murmured; something like &quot;Gentucca&quot; was</l>
		<l>what I heard from the place where he could feel</l>
		<l>the wound of justice that denudes them so.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O soul,&quot; I said, &quot;who seems so eager to</l>
		<l>converse with me, do speak so that I hear you,</l>
		<l>for speech may satisfy both you and me.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He answered: &quot;Although men condemn my city,</l>
		<l>there is a woman born-she wears no veil</l>
		<l>as yet-because of whom you&apos;ll find it pleasing.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You are to journey with this prophecy;</l>
		<l>and if there&apos;s something in my murmuring</l>
		<l>you doubt, events themselves will bear me out.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But tell me if the man whom I see here</l>
		<l>is he who brought the new rhymes forth, beginning:</l>
		<l>&apos;Ladies who have intelligence of love.&apos;&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I answered: &quot;I am one who, when Love breathes</l>
		<l>in me, takes note; what he, within, dictates,</l>
		<l>I, in that way, without, would speak and shape.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O brother, now I see,&quot; he said, &quot;the knot</l>
		<l>that kept the Notary, Guittone, and me</l>
		<l>short of the sweet new manner that I hear.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I clearly see how your pens follow closely</l>
		<l>behind him who dictates, and certainly</l>
		<l>that did not happen with our pens; and he</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>who sets himself to ferreting profoundly</l>
		<l>can find no other difference between</l>
		<l>the two styles.&quot; He fell still, contentedly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even as birds that winter on the Nile</l>
		<l>at times will slow and form a flock in air,</l>
		<l>then speed their flight and form a file, so all</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the people who were mere moved much more swiftly,</l>
		<l>turning away their faces, hurrying</l>
		<l>their pace because of leanness and desire.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And just as he who&apos;s tired of running lets</l>
		<l>his comrades go ahead and slows his steps</l>
		<l>until he&apos;s eased the panting of his chest,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so did Forese let the holy flock</l>
		<l>pass by and move, behind, with me, saying:</l>
		<l>&quot;How long before I shall see you again?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;I do not know,&quot; I said, &quot;how long I&apos;ll live;</l>
		<l>and yet, however quick is my return,</l>
		<l>my longing for these shores would have me here</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>sooner-because the place where I was set</l>
		<l>to live is day by day deprived of good</l>
		<l>and seems along the way to wretched ruin.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Do not be vexed,&quot; he said, &quot;for I can see</l>
		<l>the guiltiest of all dragged by a beast&apos;s</l>
		<l>tail to the valley where no sin is purged.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At every step the beast moves faster, always</l>
		<l>gaining momentum, till it smashes him</l>
		<l>and leaves his body squalidly undone.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Those wheels,&quot; and here he looked up at the sky,</l>
		<l>&quot;do not have long to turn before you see</l>
		<l>plainly what I can&apos;t tell more openly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now you remain behind, for time is costly</l>
		<l>here in this kingdom; I should lose too much</l>
		<l>by moving with you thus, at equal pace.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as a horseman sometimes gallops out,</l>
		<l>leaving behind his troop of riders, so</l>
		<l>that he may gain the honor of the first</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>clash-so, with longer strides, did he leave us;</l>
		<l>and I remained along my path with those</l>
		<l>two who were such great marshals of the world.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And when he&apos;d gone so far ahead of us</l>
		<l>that my eyes strained to follow him, just as</l>
		<l>my mind was straining after what he&apos;d said,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the branches of another tree, heavy</l>
		<l>with fruit, alive with green, appeared to me</l>
		<l>nearby, just past a curve where I had turned.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Beneath the tree I saw shades lifting hands,</l>
		<l>crying I know not what up toward the branches,</l>
		<l>like little eager, empty-headed children,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>who beg-but he of whom they beg does not</l>
		<l>reply, but to provoke their longing, he</l>
		<l>holds high, and does not hide, the thing they want</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then they departed as if disabused;</l>
		<l>and we-immediately-reached that great tree,</l>
		<l>which turns aside so many prayers and tears.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Continue on, but don&apos;t draw close to it;</l>
		<l>there is a tree above from which Eve ate,</l>
		<l>and from that tree above, this plant was raised.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Among the boughs, a voice-I know not whose-</l>
		<l>spoke so; thus, drawing closer, Virgil, Statius,</l>
		<l>and I edged on, along the side that rises.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It said: &quot;Remember those with double chests,</l>
		<l>the miserable ones, born of the clouds,</l>
		<l>whom Theseus battled when they&apos;d gorged themselves</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and those whom Gideon refused as comrades-</l>
		<l>those Hebrews who had drunk too avidly-</l>
		<l>when he came down the hills to Midian.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So, keeping close to one of that road&apos;s margins,</l>
		<l>we moved ahead, hearing of gluttony-</l>
		<l>its sins repaid by sorry penalties.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then, with more space along the lonely path,</l>
		<l>a thousand steps and more had brought us forward,</l>
		<l>each of us meditating wordlessly.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;What are you thinking of, you three who walk</l>
		<l>alone?&quot; a sudden voice called out; at which</l>
		<l>I started-like a scared young animal.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I raised my head to see who it might be;</l>
		<l>no glass or metal ever seen within</l>
		<l>a furnace was so glowing or so red</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>as one I saw, who said: &quot;If you&apos;d ascend,</l>
		<l>then you must turn at this point; for whoever</l>
		<l>would journey unto peace must pass this way.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But his appearance had deprived me of</l>
		<l>my sight, so that-as one who uses hearing</l>
		<l>as guide-I turned and followed my two teachers.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And like the breeze of May that-heralding</l>
		<l>the dawning of the day-when it is steeped</l>
		<l>in flowers and in grass, stirs fragrantly,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so did I feel the wind that blew against</l>
		<l>the center of my brow, and clearly sensed</l>
		<l>the movement of his wings, the air&apos;s ambrosia.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then I heard: &quot;Blessed are those whom grace</l>
		<l>illumines so, that, in their breasts, the love</l>
		<l>of taste does not awake too much desire-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>whose hungering is always in just measure.&quot;</l>
