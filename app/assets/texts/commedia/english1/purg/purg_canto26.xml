	<p>
		<l>While we moved at the edge, one first, one after,</l>
		<l>and I could often hear my gentle master</l>
		<l>saying: &quot;Take care-and do not waste my warning,&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the sun, its rays already altering</l>
		<l>the coloring of all the west from azure</l>
		<l>to white, was striking me on my right shoulder.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And where my shadow fell, it made the flames</l>
		<l>seem more inflamed; and I saw many shades</l>
		<l>walking, intent upon a sight so strange.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>This was the reason that first prompted them</l>
		<l>to speak to me. Among themselves they said:</l>
		<l>&quot;He does not seem to have a fictive body.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then certain of them came as close to me</l>
		<l>as they were able to while, cautiously,</l>
		<l>they never left the boundaries of their burning.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;O you who move behind the others not</l>
		<l>because of sloth but reverence perhaps,</l>
		<l>give me who burn in thirst and fire your answer.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I&apos;m not alone in needing your response;</l>
		<l>for all these shades thirst so for it-more than</l>
		<l>an Indian or Ethiopian</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>thirsts for cool water. Tell us how you can-</l>
		<l>as if you&apos;re not yet caught within death&apos;s net-</l>
		<l>make of yourself a wall against the sun.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Thus one of them had spoken to me; I</l>
		<l>should now have answered clearly, had I not</l>
		<l>been fixed on something strangely evident;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>for in the middle of the burning path,</l>
		<l>came people moving opposite to these-</l>
		<l>and I, since they moved left, stared in suspense.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There, on all sides, I can see every shade</l>
		<l>move quickly to embrace another shade,</l>
		<l>content-they did not pause-with their brief greeti</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>as ants, in their dark company, will touch</l>
		<l>their muzzles, each to each, perhaps to seek</l>
		<l>news of their fortunes and their journeyings.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No sooner is their friendly greeting done</l>
		<l>than each shade tries to outcry all the rest</l>
		<l>even before he starts to move ahead,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the new group shouting: &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot;;</l>
		<l>the other: &quot;That the bull may hurry toward</l>
		<l>her lust, Pasiphae hides in the cow.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then, just like cranes, of whom a part, to flee</l>
		<l>the sun, fly north to Riphean mountains, while</l>
		<l>the rest, to flee the frost, fly toward the sands,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>one group moves with-the other opposite-us;</l>
		<l>and they return with tears to their first chants</l>
		<l>and to the shout appropriate to each.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And those who had entreated me came close</l>
		<l>again, in the same way they&apos;d done before;</l>
		<l>their faces showed how keen they were to listen.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I, seeing their desire once again,</l>
		<l>began: &quot;O souls who can be sure of gaining</l>
		<l>the state of peace, whenever that may be,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>my limbs-mature or green-have not been left</l>
		<l>within the world beyond; they&apos;re here with me,</l>
		<l>together with their blood and with their bones.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That I be blind no longer, through this place</l>
		<l>I pass; above, a lady has gained grace</l>
		<l>for me; therefore, I bear my mortal body</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>across your world. So may your deepest longing</l>
		<l>soon be appeased and you be lodged within</l>
		<l>the heaven that&apos;s most full of love, most spacious</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>please tell me, so that I may yet transcribe it</l>
		<l>upon my pages, who you are, and what</l>
		<l>crowd moves in the direction opposite.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Each shade displayed no less astonishment</l>
		<l>or less confusion than a mountaineer,</l>
		<l>who, even as he stares about, falls silent</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when, rough and rustic, he comes to the city;</l>
		<l>but when they&apos;d set aside astonishment-</l>
		<l>that&apos;s soon subdued in noble hearts-he who</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>had questioned me before, began again:</l>
		<l>&quot;Blessed are you who would, in order to</l>
		<l>die better, store experience of our lands!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The people moving opposite us shared</l>
		<l>the sin for which once, while in triumph, Caesar</l>
		<l>heard &apos;Queen&apos; called out against him; that is why,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>as they move off from us, they cry out &apos;Sodom,&apos;</l>
		<l>reproaching their own selves, as you have heard,</l>
		<l>and through their shame abet the fire&apos;s work.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Our sin was with the other sex; but since</l>
		<l>we did not keep the bounds of human law,</l>
		<l>but served our appetites like beasts, when we</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>part from the other ranks, we then repeat,</l>
		<l>to our disgrace, the name of one who, in</l>
		<l>the bestial planks, became herself a beast.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You now know why we act so, and you know</l>
		<l>what our sins were; if you would know our names,</l>
		<l>time is too short, and I don&apos;t know them all.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But with regard to me, I&apos;ll satisfy</l>
		<l>your wish to know: I&apos;m Guido Guinizzelli,</l>
		<l>purged here because I grieved before my end.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As, after the sad raging of Lycurgus,</l>
		<l>two sons, finding their mother, had embraced her,</l>
		<l>so I desired to do-but dared not to-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when I heard him declare his name: the father</l>
		<l>of me and of the others-those, my betters-</l>
		<l>who ever used sweet, gracious rhymes of love.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And without hearing, speaking, pensive, I</l>
		<l>walked on, still gazing at him, a long time,</l>
		<l>prevented by the fire from drawing closer.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When I had fed my sight on him, I offered</l>
		<l>myself-with such a pledge that others must</l>
		<l>believe-completely ready for his service.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And he to me: &quot;Because of what I hear,</l>
		<l>you leave a trace within me-one so clear,</l>
		<l>Lethe itself can&apos;t blur or cancel it.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But if your words have now sworn truthfully,</l>
		<l>do tell me why it is that you have shown</l>
		<l>in speech and gaze that I am dear to you.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And I to him: &quot;It&apos;s your sweet lines that, for</l>
		<l>as long as modern usage lasts, will still</l>
		<l>make dear their very inks.&quot; &quot;Brother,&quot; he said,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;he there, whom I point out to you&quot;-he showed</l>
		<l>us one who walked ahead-&quot;he was a better</l>
		<l>artisan of the mother tongue, surpassing</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>all those who wrote their poems of love or prose</l>
		<l>romances-let the stupid ones contend,</l>
		<l>who think that from Limoges there came the best.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>They credit rumor rather than the truth,</l>
		<l>allowing their opinion to be set</l>
		<l>before they hear what art or reason says.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So, many of our fathers once persisted,</l>
		<l>voice after voice, in giving to Guittone</l>
		<l>the prize-but then, with most, the truth prevailed</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now if you are so amply privileged</l>
		<l>that you will be admitted to the cloister</l>
		<l>where Christ is abbot of the college, then</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>pray say, for me, to Him, a Paternoster-</l>
		<l>that is, as much of it as those in this</l>
		<l>place need, since we have lost the power to sin.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then, to make place, perhaps, for those behind him</l>
		<l>he disappeared into the fire, just as</l>
		<l>a fish, through water, plunges toward the bottom.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Saying that my desire was making ready</l>
		<l>a place of welcome for his name, I moved</l>
		<l>ahead a little, toward the one who had</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>been pointed out to me. And he spoke freely:</l>
		<l>&quot;So does your courteous request please me-</l>
		<l>I neither could nor would conceal myself</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>from you. I am Arnaut, who, going, weep</l>
		<l>and sing; with grief, I see my former folly;</l>
		<l>with joy, I see the hoped-for day draw near.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Now, by the Power that conducts you to</l>
		<l>the summit of the stairway, I pray you:</l>
		<l>remember, at time opportune, my pain!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then, in the fire that refines, he hid.</l>
	</p>
