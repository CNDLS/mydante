	<p>
		<l>Just as, there where its Maker shed His blood,</l>
		<l>the sun shed its first rays, and Ebro lay</l>
		<l>beneath high Libra, and the ninth hour&apos;s rays</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>were scorching Ganges&apos; waves; so here, the sun</l>
		<l>stood at the point of day&apos;s departure when</l>
		<l>God&apos;s angel-happy-showed himself to us.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He stood along the edge, beyond the flames,</l>
		<l>singing &quot;Beati mundo corde&quot; in</l>
		<l>a voice that had more life than ours can claim.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then: &quot;Holy souls, you cannot move ahead</l>
		<l>unless the fire has stung you first: enter</l>
		<l>the flames, and don&apos;t be deaf to song you&apos;ll hear</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>beyond,&quot; he said when we were close to him;</l>
		<l>and when I heard him say this, I became</l>
		<l>like one who has been laid within the grave.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I joined my hands and stretched them out to fend</l>
		<l>the flames, watching the fire, imagining</l>
		<l>clearly the human bodies I&apos;d once seen</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>burning. My gentle escorts turned to me,</l>
		<l>and Virgil said: &quot;My son, though there may be</l>
		<l>suffering here, there is no death. Remember,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>remember! If I guided you to safety</l>
		<l>even upon the back of Geryon,</l>
		<l>then now, closer to God, what shall I do?</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Be sure: although you were to spend a full</l>
		<l>one thousand years within this fire&apos;s center,</l>
		<l>your head would not be balder by one hair.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And if you think I am deceiving you,</l>
		<l>draw closer to the flames, let your own hands</l>
		<l>try out, within the fire, your clothing&apos;s hem-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>put down, by now put down, your every fear;</l>
		<l>turn toward the fire, and enter, confident!&quot;</l>
		<l>But I was stubborn, set against my conscience.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When he saw me still halting, obstinate,</l>
		<l>he said, somewhat perplexed: &quot;Now see, son: this</l>
		<l>wall stands between you and your Beatrice.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As, at the name of Thisbe, Pyramus,</l>
		<l>about to die, opened his eyes, and saw her</l>
		<l>(when then the mulberry became bloodred),</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so, when my stubbornness had softened, I,</l>
		<l>hearing the name that&apos;s always flowering</l>
		<l>within my mind, turned to my knowing guide.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At which he shook his head and said: &quot;And would</l>
		<l>you have us stay along this side?&quot;-then smiled</l>
		<l>as one smiles at a child fruit has beguiled.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then he, ahead of me, entered the fire;</l>
		<l>and he asked Statius, who had walked between us</l>
		<l>before, dividing us, to go behind.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>No sooner was I in that fire than I&apos;d</l>
		<l>have thrown myself in molten glass to find</l>
		<l>coolness-because those flames were so intense.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My gentle father, who would comfort me,</l>
		<l>kept talking, as we walked, of Beatrice,</l>
		<l>saying: &quot;I seem to see her eyes already.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>A voice that sang beyond us was our guide;</l>
		<l>and we, attentive to that voice, emerged</l>
		<l>just at the point where it began to climb.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Venite, benedicti Patris mei,&quot;</l>
		<l>it sang within a light that overcame me:</l>
		<l>I could not look at such intensity.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;The sun departs,&quot; it added; &quot;evening comes;</l>
		<l>don&apos;t stay your steps, but hurry on before</l>
		<l>the west grows dark.&quot; The path we took climbed str</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>within the rock, and its direction was</l>
		<l>such that, in front of me, my body blocked</l>
		<l>the rays of sun, already low behind us.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And we had only tried a few steps when</l>
		<l>I and my sages sensed the sun had set</l>
		<l>because the shadow I had cast was spent.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Before one color came to occupy</l>
		<l>that sky in all of its immensity</l>
		<l>and night was free to summon all its darkness,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>each of us made one of those stairs his bed:</l>
		<l>the nature of the mountain had so weakened</l>
		<l>our power and desire to climb ahead.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Like goats that, when they grazed, were swift and </l>
		<l>along the mountain peaks, but now are sated,</l>
		<l>and rest and ruminate-while the sun blazes-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>untroubled, in the shadows, silently,</l>
		<l>watched over by the herdsman as he leans</l>
		<l>upon his staff and oversees their peace;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>or like the herdsman in the open fields,</l>
		<l>spending the night beside his quiet flock,</l>
		<l>watching to see that no beast drives them off;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>such were all three of us at that point-they</l>
		<l>were like the herdsmen, I was like the goat;</l>
		<l>upon each side of us, high rock walls rose.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>From there, one saw but little of the sky,</l>
		<l>but in that little, I could see the stars</l>
		<l>brighter and larger than they usually are.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But while I watched the stars, in reverie,</l>
		<l>sleep overcame me-sleep, which often sees,</l>
		<l>before it happens, what is yet to be.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>It was the hour, I think, when Cytherea,</l>
		<l>who always seems aflame with fires of love,</l>
		<l>first shines upon the mountains from the east,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that, in my dream, I seemed to see a woman</l>
		<l>both young and fair; along a plain she gathered</l>
		<l>flowers, and even as she sang, she said:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Whoever asks my name, know that I&apos;m Leah,</l>
		<l>and I apply my lovely hands to fashion</l>
		<l>a garland of the flowers I have gathered.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>To find delight within this mirror I</l>
		<l>adorn myself; whereas my sister Rachel</l>
		<l>never deserts her mirror; there she sits</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>all day; she longs to see her fair eyes gazing,</l>
		<l>as I, to see my hands adorning, long:</l>
		<l>she is content with seeing, I with labor.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And now, with the reflected lights that glow</l>
		<l>before the dawn and, rising, are most welcome</l>
		<l>to pilgrims as, returning, they near home,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the shadows fled upon all sides; my sleep</l>
		<l>fled with them; and at this, I woke and saw</l>
		<l>that the great teachers had already risen.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Today your hungerings will find their peace</l>
		<l>through that sweet fruit the care of mortals seeks</l>
		<l>among so many branches.&quot; This, the speech,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the solemn words, that Virgil spoke to me;</l>
		<l>and there were never tidings to compare,</l>
		<l>in offering delight to me, with these.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My will on will to climb above was such</l>
		<l>that at each step I took I felt the force</l>
		<l>within my wings was growing for the flight.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>When all the staircase lay beneath us and</l>
		<l>we&apos;d reached the highest step, then Virgil set</l>
		<l>his eyes insistently on me and said:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;My son, you&apos;ve seen the temporary fire</l>
		<l>and the eternal fire; you have reached</l>
		<l>the place past which my powers cannot see.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I&apos;ve brought you here through intellect and art;</l>
		<l>from now on, let your pleasure be your guide;</l>
		<l>you&apos;re past the steep and past the narrow paths.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Look at the sun that shines upon your brow;</l>
		<l>look at the grasses, flowers, and the shrubs</l>
		<l>born here, spontaneously, of the earth.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Among them, you can rest or walk until</l>
		<l>the coming of the glad and lovely eyes-</l>
		<l>those eyes that, weeping, sent me to your side.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Await no further word or sign from me:</l>
		<l>your will is free, erect, and whole-to act</l>
		<l>against that will would be to err: therefore</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I crown and miter you over yourself.&quot;</l>
	</p>
