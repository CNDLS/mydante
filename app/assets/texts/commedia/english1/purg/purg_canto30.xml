	<p>
		<l>When the first heaven&apos;s Seven-Stars had halted</l>
		<l>(those stars that never rise or set, that are</l>
		<l>not veiled except when sin beclouds our vision;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>those stars that, there, made everyone aware</l>
		<l>of what his duty was, just as the Bear</l>
		<l>below brings helmsmen home to harbor), then</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the truthful band that had come first between</l>
		<l>the griffin and the Seven-Stars turned toward</l>
		<l>that chariot as toward their peace, and one</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of them, as if sent down from Heaven, hymned</l>
		<l>aloud, &quot; Veni, sponsa, de Libano,&quot;</l>
		<l>three times, and all the others echoed him.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just as the blessed, at the Final Summons,</l>
		<l>will rise up-ready-each out of his grave,</l>
		<l>singing, with new-clothed voices, Alleluia,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so, from the godly chariot, eternal</l>
		<l>life&apos;s messengers and ministers arose:</l>
		<l>one hundred stood ad vocem tanti senis.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>All of them cried: &quot;Benedictus qui venis,&apos;&apos;</l>
		<l>and, scattering flowers upward and around,</l>
		<l>&quot;Manibus, oh, date lilia plenis.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I have at times seen all the eastern sky</l>
		<l>becoming rose as day began and seen,</l>
		<l>adorned in lovely blue, the rest of heaven;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and seen the sun&apos;s face rise so veiled that it</l>
		<l>was tempered by the mist and could permit</l>
		<l>the eye to look at length upon it; so,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>within a cloud of flowers that were cast</l>
		<l>by the angelic hands and then rose up</l>
		<l>and then fell back, outside and in the chariot,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>a woman showed herself to me; above</l>
		<l>a white veil, she was crowned with olive boughs;</l>
		<l>her cape was green; her dress beneath, flame-red.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Within her presence, I had once been used</l>
		<l>to feeling-trembling-wonder, dissolution;</l>
		<l>but that was long ago. Still, though my soul,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>now she was veiled, could not see her directly,</l>
		<l>by way of hidden force that she could move,</l>
		<l>I felt the mighty power of old love.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As soon as that deep force had struck my vision</l>
		<l>(the power that, when I had not yet left</l>
		<l>my boyhood, had already transfixed me),</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I turned around and to my left-just as</l>
		<l>a little child, afraid or in distress,</l>
		<l>will hurry to his mother-anxiously,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to say to Virgil: &quot;I am left with less</l>
		<l>than one drop of my blood that does not tremble:</l>
		<l>I recognize the signs of the old flame.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But Virgil had deprived us of himself,</l>
		<l>Virgil, the gentlest father, Virgil, he</l>
		<l>to whom I gave my self for my salvation;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and even all our ancient mother lost</l>
		<l>was not enough to keep my cheeks, though washed</l>
		<l>with dew, from darkening again with tears.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Dante, though Virgil&apos;s leaving you, do not</l>
		<l>yet weep, do not weep yet; you&apos;ll need your tears</l>
		<l>for what another sword must yet inflict.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Just like an admiral who goes to stern</l>
		<l>and prow to see the officers who guide</l>
		<l>the other ships, encouraging their tasks;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so, on the left side of the chariot</l>
		<l>(I&apos;d turned around when I had heard my name-</l>
		<l>which, of necessity, I transcribe here),</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw the lady who had first appeared</l>
		<l>to me beneath the veils of the angelic</l>
		<l>flowers look at me across the stream.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Although the veil she wore-down from her head,</l>
		<l>which was encircled by Minerva&apos;s leaves-</l>
		<l>did not allow her to be seen distinctly,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>her stance still regal and disdainful, she</l>
		<l>continued, just as one who speaks but keeps</l>
		<l>until the end the fiercest parts of speech:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Look here! For I am Beatrice, I am!</l>
		<l>How were you able to ascend the mountain?</l>
		<l>Did you not know that man is happy here?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My lowered eyes caught sight of the clear stream,</l>
		<l>but when I saw myself reflected there,</l>
		<l>such shame weighed on my brow, my eyes drew back</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and toward the grass; just as a mother seems</l>
		<l>harsh to her child, so did she seem to me-</l>
		<l>how bitter is the savor of stern pity!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Her words were done. The angels-suddenly-</l>
		<l>sang, &quot;In te, Domine, speravi&quot;; but</l>
		<l>their singing did not go past &quot;pedes meos.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even as snow among the sap-filled trees</l>
		<l>along the spine of Italy will freeze</l>
		<l>when gripped by gusts of the Slavonian winds,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>then, as it melts, will trickle through itself-</l>
		<l>that is, if winds breathe north from shade-less la</l>
		<l>just as, beneath the flame, the candle melts;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>so I, before I&apos;d heard the song of those</l>
		<l>whose notes always accompany the notes</l>
		<l>of the eternal spheres, was without tears</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and sighs; but when I heard the sympathy</l>
		<l>for me within their gentle harmonies,</l>
		<l>as if they&apos;d said: &quot;Lady, why shame him so?&quot;-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>then did the ice that had restrained my heart</l>
		<l>become water and breath; and from my breast</l>
		<l>and through my lips and eyes they issued-anguished</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Still standing motionless upon the left</l>
		<l>side of the chariot, she then addressed</l>
		<l>the angels who had been compassionate:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;You are awake in never-ending day,</l>
		<l>and neither night nor sleep can steal from you</l>
		<l>one step the world would take along its way;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>therefore, I&apos;m more concerned that my reply</l>
		<l>be understood by him who weeps beyond,</l>
		<l>so that his sorrow&apos;s measure match his sin.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Not only through the work of the great spheres-</l>
		<l>which guide each seed to a determined end,</l>
		<l>depending on what stars are its companions-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>but through the bounty of the godly graces,</l>
		<l>which shower down from clouds so high that we</l>
		<l>cannot approach them with our vision, he,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when young, was such-potentially-that any</l>
		<l>propensity innate in him would have</l>
		<l>prodigiously succeeded, had he acted.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But where the soil has finer vigor, there</l>
		<l>precisely-when untilled or badly seeded-</l>
		<l>will that terrain grow wilder and more noxious.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My countenance sustained him for a while;</l>
		<l>showing my youthful eyes to him, I led</l>
		<l>him with me toward the way of righteousness.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>As soon as I, upon the threshold of</l>
		<l>my second age, had changed my life, he took</l>
		<l>himself away from me and followed after</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>another; when, from flesh to spirit, I</l>
		<l>had risen, and my goodness and my beauty</l>
		<l>had grown, I was less dear to him, less welcome:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>he turned his footsteps toward an untrue path;</l>
		<l>he followed counterfeits of goodness, which</l>
		<l>will never pay in full what they have promised.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Nor did the inspirations I received-</l>
		<l>with which, in dream and otherwise, I called</l>
		<l>him back-help me; he paid so little heed!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He fell so far there were no other means</l>
		<l>to lead him to salvation, except this:</l>
		<l>to let him see the people who were lost.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>For this I visited the gateway of</l>
		<l>the dead; to him who guided him above</l>
		<l>my prayers were offered even as I wept.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The deep design of God would have been broken</l>
		<l>if Lethe had been crossed and he had drunk</l>
		<l>such waters but had not discharged the debt</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of penitence that&apos;s paid when tears are shed.&quot;</l>
