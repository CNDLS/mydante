		<l>When glad and gracious welcomings had been</l>
		<l>repeated three and four times, then Sordello</l>
		<l>drew himself back and asked: &quot;But who are you?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Before the spirits worthy of ascent</l>
		<l>to God had been directed to this mountain,</l>
		<l>my bones were buried by Octavian.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I am Virgil, and I am deprived of Heaven</l>
		<l>for no fault other than my lack of faith.&quot;</l>
		<l>This was the answer given by my guide.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even like one who, suddenly, has seen</l>
		<l>something before him and then, marveling,</l>
		<l>does and does not believe, saying, &quot;It is...</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>is not,&quot; so did Sordello seem, and then</l>
		<l>he bent his brow, returned to Virgil humbly,</l>
		<l>and clasped him where the lesser presence clasps.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He said: &quot;O glory of the Latins, you</l>
		<l>through whom our tongue revealed its power, you,</l>
		<l>eternal honor of my native city,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>what merit or what grace shows you to me?</l>
		<l>If I deserve to hear your word, then answer:</l>
		<l>tell me if you&apos;re from Hell and from what cloister</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Through every circle of the sorry kingdom,&quot;</l>
		<l>he answered him, &quot;I journeyed here; a power</l>
		<l>from Heaven moved me, and with that, I come.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Not for the having-but not having-done,</l>
		<l>I lost the sight that you desire, the Sun-</l>
		<l>that high Sun I was late in recognizing.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There is a place below that only shadows-</l>
		<l>not torments-have assigned to sadness; there,</l>
		<l>lament is not an outcry, but a sigh.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There I am with the infant innocents,</l>
		<l>those whom the teeth of death had seized before</l>
		<l>they were set free from human sinfulness;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>there I am with those souls who were not clothed</l>
		<l>in the three holy virtues-but who knew</l>
		<l>and followed after all the other virtues.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But if you know and you are able to,</l>
		<l>would you point out the path that leads more quick</l>
		<l>to the true entry point of Purgatory?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He answered: &quot;No fixed place has been assigned</l>
		<l>to us; I&apos;m free to range about and climb;</l>
		<l>as far as I may go, I&apos;ll be your guide.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>But see now how the day declines; by night</l>
		<l>we cannot climb; and therefore it is best</l>
		<l>to find some pleasant place where we can rest.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Here to the right are spirits set apart;</l>
		<l>if you allow me, I shall lead you to them;</l>
		<l>and not without delight, you&apos;ll come to know them.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;How is that?&quot; he was asked. &quot;Is it that he</l>
		<l>who tried to climb by night would be impeded</l>
		<l>by others, or by his own lack of power?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And good Sordello, as his finger traced</l>
		<l>along the ground, said: &quot;Once the sun has set,</l>
		<l>then-look-even this line cannot be crossed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And not that anything except the dark</l>
		<l>of night prevents your climbing up; it is</l>
		<l>the night itself that implicates your will.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Once darkness falls, one can indeed retreat</l>
		<l>below and wander aimlessly about</l>
		<l>the slopes, while the horizon has enclosed</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the day.&quot; At which my lord, as if in wonder,</l>
		<l>said: &quot;Lead us then to there where, as you say,</l>
		<l>we may derive delight from this night&apos;s stay.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>We had not gone far off, when I perceived</l>
		<l>that, just as valleys hollow mountains here</l>
		<l>in our world, so that mountain there was hollowed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>That shade said: &quot;It is there that we shall go-</l>
		<l>to where the slope forms, of itself, a lap;</l>
		<l>at that place we&apos;ll await the new day&apos;s coming.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There was a slanting path, now steep, now flat;</l>
		<l>it led us to a point beside the valley,</l>
		<l>just where its bordering edge had dropped by half.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Gold and fine silver, cochineal, white lead,</l>
		<l>and Indian lychnite, highly polished, bright,</l>
		<l>fresh emerald at the moment it is dampened,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>if placed within that valley, all would be</l>
		<l>defeated by the grass and flowers&apos; colors,</l>
		<l>just as the lesser gives way to the greater.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And nature there not only was a painter,</l>
		<l>but from the sweetness of a thousand odors,</l>
		<l>she had derived an unknown, mingled scent.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Upon the green grass and the flowers, I</l>
		<l>saw seated spirits singing &quot;Salve, Regina&quot;;</l>
		<l>they were not visible from the outside.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Before the meager sun seeks out its nest,&quot;</l>
		<l>began the Mantuan who led us here,</l>
		<l>&quot;do not ask me to guide you down among them.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>From this bank, you&apos;ll be better able to</l>
		<l>make out the acts and features of them all</l>
		<l>than if you were to join them in the hollow.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He who is seated highest, with the look</l>
		<l>of one too lax in what he undertook-</l>
		<l>whose mouth, although the rest sing, does not move</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>was Emperor Rudolph, one who could have healed</l>
		<l>the wounds that were the death of Italy,</l>
		<l>so that another, later, must restore her.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>His neighbor, whose appearance comforts him,</l>
		<l>governed the land in which are born the waters</l>
		<l>the Moldau carries to the Elbe and</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the Elbe to the sea: named Ottokar-</l>
		<l>in swaddling-bands he was more valiant than</l>
		<l>his son, the bearded Wenceslaus, who feeds</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>on wantonness and ease. That small-nosed man,</l>
		<l>who seems so close in counsel with his kindly</l>
		<l>friend, died in flight, deflowering the lily:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>see how he beats his breast there! And you see</l>
		<l>the other shade, who, as he sighs, would rest</l>
		<l>his cheek upon his palm as on a bed.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Father and father-in-law of the pest</l>
		<l>of France, they know his life-its filth, its vice;</l>
		<l>out of that knowledge grows the grief that has</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>pierced them. That other, who seems so robust</l>
		<l>and sings in time with him who has a nose</l>
		<l>so manly, wore the cord of every virtue;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and if the young man seated there behind him</l>
		<l>had only followed him as king, then valor</l>
		<l>might have been poured from vessel unto vessel;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>one cannot say this of his other heirs;</l>
		<l>his kingdoms now belong to James and Frederick-</l>
		<l>but they do not possess his best bequest.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>How seldom human worth ascends from branch</l>
		<l>to branch, and this is willed by Him who grants</l>
		<l>that gift, that one may pray to Him for it!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My words suggest the large-nosed one no less</l>
		<l>than they refer to Peter, singing with him,</l>
		<l>whose heir brings Puglia and Provence distress:</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the plant is lesser than its seed, just as</l>
		<l>the man whom Beatrice and Margaret wed</l>
		<l>is lesser than the husband Constance has.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>You see the king who led the simple life</l>
		<l>seated alone: Henry of England-he</l>
		<l>has better fortune with his progeny.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He who is seated lowest on the ground,</l>
		<l>and looking up, is William the Marquis-</l>
		<l>for him, both Alexandria and its war</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>make Monferrato and Canavese mourn.&quot;</l>
