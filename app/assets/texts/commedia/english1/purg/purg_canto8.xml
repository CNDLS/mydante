		<l>It was the hour that turns seafarers&apos; longings</l>
		<l>homeward-the hour that makes their hearts grow ten</l>
		<l>upon the day they bid sweet friends farewell;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the hour that pierces the new traveler</l>
		<l>with love when he has heard, far off, the bell</l>
		<l>that seems to mourn the dying of the day;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>when I began to let my hearing fade</l>
		<l>and watched one of those souls who, having risen,</l>
		<l>had signaled with his hand for our attention.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He joined his palms and, lifting them, he fixed</l>
		<l>all his attention on the east, as if</l>
		<l>to say to God: &quot;I care for nothing else.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Te lucis ante&quot; issued from his lips</l>
		<l>with such devotion and with notes so sweet</l>
		<l>that I was moved to move beyond my mind.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And then the other spirits followed him-</l>
		<l>devoutly, gently-through all of that hymn,</l>
		<l>their eyes intent on the supernal spheres.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Here, reader, let your eyes look sharp at truth,</l>
		<l>for now the veil has grown so very thin-</l>
		<l>it is not difficult to pass within.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I saw that company of noble spirits,</l>
		<l>silent and looking upward, pale and humble,</l>
		<l>as if in expectation; and I saw,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>emerging and descending from above,</l>
		<l>two angels bearing flaming swords, of which</l>
		<l>the blades were broken off, without their tips.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Their garments, just as green as newborn leaves,</l>
		<l>were agitated, fanned by their green wings,</l>
		<l>and trailed behind them; and one angel came</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>and stood somewhat above us, while the other</l>
		<l>descended on the opposite embankment,</l>
		<l>flanking that company of souls between them.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My eyes made out their blond heads clearly, but</l>
		<l>my sight was dazzled by their faces-just</l>
		<l>like any sense bewildered by excess.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;Both come from Mary&apos;s bosom,&quot; said Sordello,</l>
		<l>&quot;to serve as the custodians of the valley</l>
		<l>against the serpent that will soon appear.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At this, not knowing where its path might be,</l>
		<l>frozen with fear, I turned around, pressing</l>
		<l>close to the trusty shoulders. And Sordello</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>continued: &quot;Let us now descend among</l>
		<l>the great shades in the valley; we shall speak</l>
		<l>with them; and seeing you, they will be pleased.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I think that I had taken but three steps</l>
		<l>to go below, when I saw one who watched</l>
		<l>attentively, trying to recognize me.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The hour had now arrived when air grows dark,</l>
		<l>but not so dark that it deprived my eyes</l>
		<l>and his of what-before-they were denied.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>He moved toward me, and I advanced toward him.</l>
		<l>Noble Judge Nino-what delight was mine</l>
		<l>when I saw you were not among the damned!</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>There was no gracious greeting we neglected</l>
		<l>before he asked me: &quot;When did you arrive,</l>
		<l>across long seas, beneath this mountainside?&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I told him, &quot;Oh, by way of the sad regions,</l>
		<l>I came this morning; I am still within</l>
		<l>the first life-although, by this journeying,</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I earn the other.&quot; When they heard my answer,</l>
		<l>Sordello and Judge Nino, just behind him,</l>
		<l>drew back like people suddenly astonished.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>One turned to Virgil, and the other turned</l>
		<l>and called to one who sat there: &quot;Up, Currado!</l>
		<l>Come see what God, out of His grace, has willed!&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then, when he turned to me: &quot;By that especial</l>
		<l>gratitude you owe to Him who hides</l>
		<l>his primal aim so that no human mind</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>may find the ford to it, when you return</l>
		<l>across the wide waves, ask my own Giovanna-</l>
		<l>there where the pleas of innocents are answered-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>to pray for me. I do not think her mother</l>
		<l>still loves me: she gave up her white veils-surely</l>
		<l>poor woman, she will wish them back again.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Through her, one understands so easily</l>
		<l>how brief, in woman, is love&apos;s fire-when not</l>
		<l>rekindled frequently by eye or touch.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The serpent that assigns the Milanese</l>
		<l>their camping place will not provide for her</l>
		<l>a tomb as fair as would Gallura&apos;s rooster.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>So Nino spoke; his bearing bore the seal</l>
		<l>of that unswerving zeal which, though it flames</l>
		<l>within the heart, maintains a sense of measure.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>My avid eyes were steadfast, staring at</l>
		<l>that portion of the sky where stars are slower,</l>
		<l>even as spokes when they approach the axle.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And my guide: &quot;Son, what are you staring at?&quot;</l>
		<l>And I replied: &quot;I&apos;m watching those three torches</l>
		<l>with which this southern pole is all aflame.&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Then he to me: &quot;The four bright stars you saw</l>
		<l>this morning now are low, beyond the pole,</l>
		<l>and where those four stars were, these three now a</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Even as Virgil spoke, Sordello drew</l>
		<l>him to himself: &quot;See there-our adversary!&quot;</l>
		<l>he said; and then he pointed with his finger.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>At the unguarded edge of that small valley,</l>
		<l>there was a serpent-similar, perhaps,</l>
		<l>to that which offered Eve the bitter food.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Through grass and flowers the evil streak advanced</l>
		<l>from time to time it turned its head and licked</l>
		<l>its back, like any beast that preens and sleeks.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>I did not see-and therefore cannot say-</l>
		<l>just how the hawks of heaven made their move,</l>
		<l>but I indeed saw both of them in motion.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Hearing the green wings cleave the air, the serpent</l>
		<l>fled, and the angels wheeled around as each</l>
		<l>of them flew upward, back to his high station.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>The shade who, when the judge had called, had draw</l>
		<l>closer to him, through all of that attack,</l>
		<l>had not removed his eyes from me one moment.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>&quot;So may the lantern that leads you on high</l>
		<l>discover in your will the wax one needs-</l>
		<l>enough for reaching the enameled peak,&quot;</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>that shade began, &quot;if you have heard true tidings</l>
		<l>of Val di Magra or the lands nearby,</l>
		<l>tell them to me-for there I once was mighty.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Currado Malaspina was my name;</l>
		<l>I&apos;m not the old Currado, but I am</l>
		<l>descended from him: to my own I bore</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>the love that here is purified.&quot; I answered:</l>
		<l>never visited your lands; but can</l>
		<l>there be a place in all of Europe where</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>they are not celebrated? Such renown</l>
		<l>honors your house, acclaims your lords and lands-</l>
		<l>even if one has yet to journey there.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>And so may I complete my climb, I swear</l>
		<l>to you: your honored house still claims the prize-</l>
		<l>the glory of the purse and of the sword.</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>Custom and nature privilege it so</l>
		<l>that, though the evil head contorts the world,</l>
		<l>your kin alone walk straight and shun the path</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>of wickedness.&quot; And he: &quot;Be sure of that.</l>
		<l>The sun will not have rested seven times</l>
		<l>within the bed that&apos;s covered and held fast</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>by all the Ram&apos;s four feet before this gracious</l>
		<l>opinion&apos;s squarely nailed into your mind</l>
		<l>with stouter nails than others&apos; talk provides-</l>
	</p>
	<p>
		<l>if the divine decree has not been stayed.&quot;</l>
