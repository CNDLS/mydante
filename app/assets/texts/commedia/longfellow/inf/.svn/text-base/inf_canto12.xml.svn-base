    <l>The place where to descend the bank we came</l>
    <l>Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,</l>
    <l>Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such as that ruin is which in the flank</l>
    <l>Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,</l>
    <l>Either by earthquake or by failing stay,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For from the mountain's top, from which it moved,</l>
    <l>Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,</l>
    <l>Some path 'twould give to him who was above;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even such was the descent of that ravine,</l>
    <l>And on the border of the broken chasm</l>
    <l>The infamy of Crete was stretched along,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;</l>
    <l>And when he us beheld, he bit himself,</l>
    <l>Even as one whom anger racks within.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My Sage towards him shouted: &quot;Peradventure</l>
    <l>Thou think'st that here may be the Duke of Athens,</l>
    <l>Who in the world above brought death to thee?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not</l>
    <l>Instructed by thy sister, but he comes</l>
    <l>In order to behold your punishments.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment</l>
    <l>In which he has received the mortal blow,</l>
    <l>Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Minotaur beheld I do the like;</l>
    <l>And he, the wary, cried: &quot;Run to the passage;</l>
    <l>While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge</l>
    <l>Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves</l>
    <l>Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thoughtful I went; and he said: &quot;Thou art thinking</l>
    <l>Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded</l>
    <l>By that brute anger which just now I quenched.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now will I have thee know, the other time</l>
    <l>I here descended to the nether Hell,</l>
    <l>This precipice had not yet fallen down.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But truly, if I well discern, a little</l>
    <l>Before His coming who the mighty spoil</l>
    <l>Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley</l>
    <l>Trembled so, that I thought the Universe</l>
    <l>Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The world ofttimes converted into chaos;</l>
    <l>And at that moment this primeval crag</l>
    <l>Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near</l>
    <l>The river of blood, within which boiling is</l>
    <l>Whoe'er by violence doth injure others.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,</l>
    <l>That spurs us onward so in our short life,</l>
    <l>And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,</l>
    <l>As one which all the plain encompasses,</l>
    <l>Conformable to what my Guide had said.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And between this and the embankment's foot</l>
    <l>Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,</l>
    <l>As in the world they used the chase to follow.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Beholding us descend, each one stood still,</l>
    <l>And from the squadron three detached themselves,</l>
    <l>With bows and arrows in advance selected;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And from afar one cried: &quot;Unto what torment</l>
    <l>Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?</l>
    <l>Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My Master said: &quot;Our answer will we make</l>
    <l>To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,</l>
    <l>That will of thine was evermore so hasty.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then touched he me, and said: &quot;This one is Nessus,</l>
    <l>Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,</l>
    <l>And for himself, himself did vengeance take.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,</l>
    <l>Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;</l>
    <l>That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thousands and thousands go about the moat</l>
    <l>Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges</l>
    <l>Out of the blood, more than his crime allots.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;</l>
    <l>Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch</l>
    <l>Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After he had uncovered his great mouth,</l>
    <l>He said to his companions: &quot;Are you ware</l>
    <l>That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.&quot;</l>
    <l>And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,</l>
    <l>Where the two natures are together joined,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Replied: &quot;Indeed he lives, and thus alone</l>
    <l>Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;</l>
    <l>Necessity, and not delight, impels us.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,</l>
    <l>Who unto me committed this new office;</l>
    <l>No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But by that virtue through which I am moving</l>
    <l>My steps along this savage thoroughfare,</l>
    <l>Give us some one of thine, to be with us,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And who may show us where to pass the ford,</l>
    <l>And who may carry this one on his back;</l>
    <l>For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,</l>
    <l>And said to Nessus: &quot;Turn and do thou guide them,</l>
    <l>And warn aside, if other band may meet you.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We with our faithful escort onward moved</l>
    <l>Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,</l>
    <l>Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>People I saw within up to the eyebrows,</l>
    <l>And the great Centaur said: &quot;Tyrants are these,</l>
    <l>Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here</l>
    <l>Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius</l>
    <l>Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That forehead there which has the hair so black</l>
    <l>Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,</l>
    <l>Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Up in the world was by his stepson slain.&quot;</l>
    <l>Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,</l>
    <l>&quot;Now he be first to thee, and second I.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A little farther on the Centaur stopped</l>
    <l>Above a folk, who far down as the throat</l>
    <l>Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A shade he showed us on one side alone,</l>
    <l>Saying: &quot;He cleft asunder in God's bosom</l>
    <l>The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then people saw I, who from out the river</l>
    <l>Lifted their heads and also all the chest;</l>
    <l>And many among these I recognised.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus ever more and more grew shallower</l>
    <l>That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;</l>
    <l>And there across the moat our passage was.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Even as thou here upon this side beholdest</l>
    <l>The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,&quot;</l>
    <l>The Centaur said, &quot;I wish thee to believe</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That on this other more and more declines</l>
    <l>Its bed, until it reunites itself</l>
    <l>Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Justice divine, upon this side, is goading</l>
    <l>That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,</l>
    <l>And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The tears which with the boiling it unseals</l>
    <l>In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,</l>
    <l>Who made upon the highways so much war.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.</l>
