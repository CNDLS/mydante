  <p>
    <l>Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,</l>
    <l>When we had put ourselves within a wood,</l>
    <l>That was not marked by any path whatever.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,</l>
    <l>Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,</l>
    <l>Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,</l>
    <l>Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold</l>
    <l>'Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,</l>
    <l>Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,</l>
    <l>With sad announcement of impending doom;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,</l>
    <l>And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;</l>
    <l>They make laments upon the wondrous trees.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the good Master: &quot;Ere thou enter farther,</l>
    <l>Know that thou art within the second round,&quot;</l>
    <l>Thus he began to say, &quot;and shalt be, till</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;</l>
    <l>Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see</l>
    <l>Things that will credence give unto my speech.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,</l>
    <l>And person none beheld I who might make them,</l>
    <l>Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I think he thought that I perhaps might think</l>
    <l>So many voices issued through those trunks</l>
    <l>From people who concealed themselves from us;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore the Master said: &quot;If thou break off</l>
    <l>Some little spray from any of these trees,</l>
    <l>The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,</l>
    <l>And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;</l>
    <l>And the trunk cried, &quot;Why dost thou mangle me?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After it had become embrowned with blood,</l>
    <l>It recommenced its cry: &quot;Why dost thou rend me?</l>
    <l>Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;</l>
    <l>Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,</l>
    <l>Even if the souls of serpents we had been.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As out of a green brand, that is on fire</l>
    <l>At one of the ends, and from the other drips</l>
    <l>And hisses with the wind that is escaping;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So from that splinter issued forth together</l>
    <l>Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip</l>
    <l>Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Had he been able sooner to believe,&quot;</l>
    <l>My Sage made answer, &quot;O thou wounded soul,</l>
    <l>What only in my verses he has seen,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;</l>
    <l>Whereas the thing incredible has caused me</l>
    <l>To put him to an act which grieveth me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But tell him who thou wast, so that by way</l>
    <l>Of some amends thy fame he may refresh</l>
    <l>Up in the world, to which he can return.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the trunk said: &quot;So thy sweet words allure me,</l>
    <l>I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,</l>
    <l>That I a little to discourse am tempted.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I am the one who both keys had in keeping</l>
    <l>Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro</l>
    <l>So softly in unlocking and in locking,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That from his secrets most men I withheld;</l>
    <l>Fidelity I bore the glorious office</l>
    <l>So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The courtesan who never from the dwelling</l>
    <l>Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,</l>
    <l>Death universal and the vice of courts,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Inflamed against me all the other minds,</l>
    <l>And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,</l>
    <l>That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My spirit, in disdainful exultation,</l>
    <l>Thinking by dying to escape disdain,</l>
    <l>Made me unjust against myself, the just.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,</l>
    <l>Do swear to you that never broke I faith</l>
    <l>Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And to the world if one of you return,</l>
    <l>Let him my memory comfort, which is lying</l>
    <l>Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Waited awhile, and then: &quot;Since he is silent,&quot;</l>
    <l>The Poet said to me, &quot;lose not the time,</l>
    <l>But speak, and question him, if more may please thee.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence I to him: &quot;Do thou again inquire</l>
    <l>Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me;</l>
    <l>For I cannot, such pity is in my heart.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore he recommenced: &quot;So may the man</l>
    <l>Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,</l>
    <l>Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To tell us in what way the soul is bound</l>
    <l>Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,</l>
    <l>If any from such members e'er is freed.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward</l>
    <l>The wind was into such a voice converted:</l>
    <l>&quot;With brevity shall be replied to you.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When the exasperated soul abandons</l>
    <l>The body whence it rent itself away,</l>
    <l>Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It falls into the forest, and no part</l>
    <l>Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,</l>
    <l>There like a grain of spelt it germinates.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;</l>
    <l>The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,</l>
    <l>Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Like others for our spoils shall we return;</l>
    <l>But not that any one may them revest,</l>
    <l>For 'tis not just to have what one casts off.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal</l>
    <l>Forest our bodies shall suspended be,</l>
    <l>Each to the thorn of his molested shade.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We were attentive still unto the trunk,</l>
    <l>Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,</l>
    <l>When by a tumult we were overtaken,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In the same way as he is who perceives</l>
    <l>The boar and chase approaching to his stand,</l>
    <l>Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And two behold! upon our left-hand side,</l>
    <l>Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,</l>
    <l>That of the forest, every fan they broke.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He who was in advance: &quot;Now help, Death, help!&quot;</l>
    <l>And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,</l>
    <l>Was shouting: &quot;Lano, were not so alert</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!&quot;</l>
    <l>And then, perchance because his breath was failing,</l>
    <l>He grouped himself together with a bush.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Behind them was the forest full of black</l>
    <l>She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot</l>
    <l>As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,</l>
    <l>And him they lacerated piece by piece,</l>
    <l>Thereafter bore away those aching members.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,</l>
    <l>And led me to the bush, that all in vain</l>
    <l>Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O Jacopo,&quot; it said, &quot;of Sant' Andrea,</l>
    <l>What helped it thee of me to make a screen?</l>
    <l>What blame have I in thy nefarious life?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When near him had the Master stayed his steps,</l>
    <l>He said: &quot;Who wast thou, that through wounds so many</l>
    <l>Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to us: &quot;O souls, that hither come</l>
    <l>To look upon the shameful massacre</l>
    <l>That has so rent away from me my leaves,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;</l>
    <l>I of that city was which to the Baptist</l>
    <l>Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Forever with his art will make it sad.</l>
    <l>And were it not that on the pass of Arno</l>
    <l>Some glimpses of him are remaining still,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it</l>
    <l>Upon the ashes left by Attila,</l>
    <l>In vain had caused their labour to be done.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of my own house I made myself a gibbet.&quot;</l>
