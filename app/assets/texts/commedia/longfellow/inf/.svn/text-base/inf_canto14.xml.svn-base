  <p>
    <l>Because the charity of my native place</l>
    <l>Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,</l>
    <l>And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then came we to the confine, where disparted</l>
    <l>The second round is from the third, and where</l>
    <l>A horrible form of Justice is beheld.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Clearly to manifest these novel things,</l>
    <l>I say that we arrived upon a plain,</l>
    <l>Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The dolorous forest is a garland to it</l>
    <l>All round about, as the sad moat to that;</l>
    <l>There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The soil was of an arid and thick sand,</l>
    <l>Not of another fashion made than that</l>
    <l>Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou</l>
    <l>By each one to be dreaded, who doth read</l>
    <l>That which was manifest unto mine eyes!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of naked souls beheld I many herds,</l>
    <l>Who all were weeping very miserably,</l>
    <l>And over them seemed set a law diverse.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;</l>
    <l>And some were sitting all drawn up together,</l>
    <l>And others went about continually.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Those who were going round were far the more,</l>
    <l>And those were less who lay down to their torment,</l>
    <l>But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,</l>
    <l>Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,</l>
    <l>As of the snow on Alp without a wind.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As Alexander, in those torrid parts</l>
    <l>Of India, beheld upon his host</l>
    <l>Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence he provided with his phalanxes</l>
    <l>To trample down the soil, because the vapour</l>
    <l>Better extinguished was while it was single;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus was descending the eternal heat,</l>
    <l>Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder</l>
    <l>Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Without repose forever was the dance</l>
    <l>Of miserable hands, now there, now here,</l>
    <l>Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Master,&quot; began I, &quot;thou who overcomest</l>
    <l>All things except the demons dire, that issued</l>
    <l>Against us at the entrance of the gate,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not</l>
    <l>The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,</l>
    <l>So that the rain seems not to ripen him?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he himself, who had become aware</l>
    <l>That I was questioning my Guide about him,</l>
    <l>Cried: &quot;Such as I was living, am I, dead.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom</l>
    <l>He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,</l>
    <l>Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if he wearied out by turns the others</l>
    <l>In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,</l>
    <l>Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,</l>
    <l>And shot his bolts at me with all his might,</l>
    <l>He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then did my Leader speak with such great force,</l>
    <l>That I had never heard him speak so loud:</l>
    <l>&quot;O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;</l>
    <l>Not any torment, saving thine own rage,</l>
    <l>Would be unto thy fury pain complete.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then he turned round to me with better lip,</l>
    <l>Saying: &quot;One of the Seven Kings was he</l>
    <l>Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;</l>
    <l>But, as I said to him, his own despites</l>
    <l>Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now follow me, and mind thou do not place</l>
    <l>As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,</l>
    <l>But always keep them close unto the wood.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes</l>
    <l>Forth from the wood a little rivulet,</l>
    <l>Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,</l>
    <l>The sinful women later share among them,</l>
    <l>So downward through the sand it went its way.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,</l>
    <l>Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;</l>
    <l>Whence I perceived that there the passage was.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;In all the rest which I have shown to thee</l>
    <l>Since we have entered in within the gate</l>
    <l>Whose threshold unto no one is denied,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes</l>
    <l>So notable as is the present river,</l>
    <l>Which all the little flames above it quenches.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him</l>
    <l>That he would give me largess of the food,</l>
    <l>For which he had given me largess of desire.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,&quot;</l>
    <l>Said he thereafterward, &quot;whose name is Crete,</l>
    <l>Under whose king the world of old was chaste.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There is a mountain there, that once was glad</l>
    <l>With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;</l>
    <l>Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle</l>
    <l>Of her own son; and to conceal him better,</l>
    <l>Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A grand old man stands in the mount erect,</l>
    <l>Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta,</l>
    <l>And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>His head is fashioned of refined gold,</l>
    <l>And of pure silver are the arms and breast;</l>
    <l>Then he is brass as far down as the fork.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From that point downward all is chosen iron,</l>
    <l>Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,</l>
    <l>And more he stands on that than on the other.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure</l>
    <l>Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,</l>
    <l>Which gathered together perforate that cavern.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From rock to rock they fall into this valley;</l>
    <l>Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;</l>
    <l>Then downward go along this narrow sluice</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Unto that point where is no more descending.</l>
    <l>They form Cocytus; what that pool may be</l>
    <l>Thou shalt behold, so here 'tis not narrated.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I to him: &quot;If so the present runnel</l>
    <l>Doth take its rise in this way from our world,</l>
    <l>Why only on this verge appears it to us?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;Thou knowest the place is round,</l>
    <l>And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,</l>
    <l>Still to the left descending to the bottom,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.</l>
    <l>Therefore if something new appear to us,</l>
    <l>It should not bring amazement to thy face.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I again: &quot;Master, where shall be found</l>
    <l>Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,</l>
    <l>And sayest the other of this rain is made?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,&quot;</l>
    <l>Replied he; &quot;but the boiling of the red</l>
    <l>Water might well solve one of them thou makest.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,</l>
    <l>There where the souls repair to lave themselves,</l>
    <l>When sin repented of has been removed.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then said he: &quot;It is time now to abandon</l>
    <l>The wood; take heed that thou come after me;</l>
    <l>A way the margins make that are not burning,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And over them all vapours are extinguished.&quot;</l>
  </p>
