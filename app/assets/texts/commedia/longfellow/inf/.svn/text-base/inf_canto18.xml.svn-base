  <p>
    <l>There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,</l>
    <l>Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,</l>
    <l>As is the circle that around it turns.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Right in the middle of the field malign</l>
    <l>There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,</l>
    <l>Of which its place the structure will recount.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Round, then, is that enclosure which remains</l>
    <l>Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,</l>
    <l>And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As where for the protection of the walls</l>
    <l>Many and many moats surround the castles,</l>
    <l>The part in which they are a figure forms,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Just such an image those presented there;</l>
    <l>And as about such strongholds from their gates</l>
    <l>Unto the outer bank are little bridges,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So from the precipice's base did crags</l>
    <l>Project, which intersected dikes and moats,</l>
    <l>Unto the well that truncates and collects them.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within this place, down shaken from the back</l>
    <l>Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet</l>
    <l>Held to the left, and I moved on behind.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,</l>
    <l>New torments, and new wielders of the lash,</l>
    <l>Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;</l>
    <l>This side the middle came they facing us,</l>
    <l>Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,</l>
    <l>The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,</l>
    <l>Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For all upon one side towards the Castle</l>
    <l>Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's;</l>
    <l>On the other side they go towards the Mountain.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This side and that, along the livid stone</l>
    <l>Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,</l>
    <l>Who cruelly were beating them behind.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs</l>
    <l>At the first blows! and sooth not any one</l>
    <l>The second waited for, nor for the third.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>While I was going on, mine eyes by one</l>
    <l>Encountered were; and straight I said: &quot;Already</l>
    <l>With sight of this one I am not unfed.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,</l>
    <l>And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,</l>
    <l>And to my going somewhat back assented;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,</l>
    <l>Lowering his face, but little it availed him;</l>
    <l>For said I: &quot;Thou that castest down thine eyes,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If false are not the features which thou bearest,</l>
    <l>Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;</l>
    <l>But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;Unwillingly I tell it;</l>
    <l>But forces me thine utterance distinct,</l>
    <l>Which makes me recollect the ancient world.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I was the one who the fair Ghisola</l>
    <l>Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,</l>
    <l>Howe'er the shameless story may be told.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;</l>
    <l>Nay, rather is this place so full of them,</l>
    <l>That not so many tongues to-day are taught</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;'</l>
    <l>And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,</l>
    <l>Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>While speaking in this manner, with his scourge</l>
    <l>A demon smote him, and said: &quot;Get thee gone</l>
    <l>Pander, there are no women here for coin.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I joined myself again unto mine Escort;</l>
    <l>Thereafterward with footsteps few we came</l>
    <l>To where a crag projected from the bank.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This very easily did we ascend,</l>
    <l>And turning to the right along its ridge,</l>
    <l>From those eternal circles we departed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When we were there, where it is hollowed out</l>
    <l>Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,</l>
    <l>The Guide said: &quot;Wait, and see that on thee strike</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The vision of those others evil-born,</l>
    <l>Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,</l>
    <l>Because together with us they have gone.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From the old bridge we looked upon the train</l>
    <l>Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,</l>
    <l>And which the scourges in like manner smite.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the good Master, without my inquiring,</l>
    <l>Said to me: &quot;See that tall one who is coming,</l>
    <l>And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Still what a royal aspect he retains!</l>
    <l>That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning</l>
    <l>The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He by the isle of Lemnos passed along</l>
    <l>After the daring women pitiless</l>
    <l>Had unto death devoted all their males.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There with his tokens and with ornate words</l>
    <l>Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden</l>
    <l>Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;</l>
    <l>Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,</l>
    <l>And also for Medea is vengeance done.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With him go those who in such wise deceive;</l>
    <l>And this sufficient be of the first valley</l>
    <l>To know, and those that in its jaws it holds.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We were already where the narrow path</l>
    <l>Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms</l>
    <l>Of that a buttress for another arch.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thence we heard people, who are making moan</l>
    <l>In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,</l>
    <l>And with their palms beating upon themselves</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The margins were incrusted with a mould</l>
    <l>By exhalation from below, that sticks there,</l>
    <l>And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The bottom is so deep, no place suffices</l>
    <l>To give us sight of it, without ascending</l>
    <l>The arch's back, where most the crag impends.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thither we came, and thence down in the moat</l>
    <l>I saw a people smothered in a filth</l>
    <l>That out of human privies seemed to flow;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And whilst below there with mine eye I search,</l>
    <l>I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,</l>
    <l>It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He screamed to me: &quot;Wherefore art thou so eager</l>
    <l>To look at me more than the other foul ones?&quot;</l>
    <l>And I to him: &quot;Because, if I remember,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I have already seen thee with dry hair,</l>
    <l>And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;</l>
    <l>Therefore I eye thee more than all the others.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:</l>
    <l>&quot;The flatteries have submerged me here below,</l>
    <l>Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then said to me the Guide: &quot;See that thou thrust</l>
    <l>Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,</l>
    <l>That with thine eyes thou well the face attain</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,</l>
    <l>Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,</l>
    <l>And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thais the harlot is it, who replied</l>
    <l>Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I</l>
    <l>Great gratitude from thee?'--'Nay, marvellous;'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And herewith let our sight be satisfied.&quot;</l>
