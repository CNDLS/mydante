    <l>O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,</l>
    <l>Ye who the things of God, which ought to be</l>
    <l>The brides of holiness, rapaciously</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For silver and for gold do prostitute,</l>
    <l>Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,</l>
    <l>Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We had already on the following tomb</l>
    <l>Ascended to that portion of the crag</l>
    <l>Which o'er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest</l>
    <l>In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,</l>
    <l>And with what justice doth thy power distribute!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw upon the sides and on the bottom</l>
    <l>The livid stone with perforations filled,</l>
    <l>All of one size, and every one was round.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater</l>
    <l>Than those that in my beautiful Saint John</l>
    <l>Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And one of which, not many years ago,</l>
    <l>I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;</l>
    <l>Be this a seal all men to undeceive.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Out of the mouth of each one there protruded</l>
    <l>The feet of a transgressor, and the legs</l>
    <l>Up to the calf, the rest within remained.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In all of them the soles were both on fire;</l>
    <l>Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,</l>
    <l>They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont</l>
    <l>To move upon the outer surface only,</l>
    <l>So likewise was it there from heel to point.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Master, who is that one who writhes himself,</l>
    <l>More than his other comrades quivering,&quot;</l>
    <l>I said, &quot;and whom a redder flame is sucking?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;If thou wilt have me bear thee</l>
    <l>Down there along that bank which lowest lies,</l>
    <l>From him thou'lt know his errors and himself.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I: &quot;What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;</l>
    <l>Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not</l>
    <l>From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;</l>
    <l>We turned, and on the left-hand side descended</l>
    <l>Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the good Master yet from off his haunch</l>
    <l>Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me</l>
    <l>Of him who so lamented with his shanks.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Whoe'er thou art, that standest upside down,</l>
    <l>O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,&quot;</l>
    <l>To say began I, &quot;if thou canst, speak out.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I stood even as the friar who is confessing</l>
    <l>The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,</l>
    <l>Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he cried out: &quot;Dost thou stand there already,</l>
    <l>Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?</l>
    <l>By many years the record lied to me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,</l>
    <l>For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud</l>
    <l>The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such I became, as people are who stand,</l>
    <l>Not comprehending what is answered them,</l>
    <l>As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then said Virgilius: &quot;Say to him straightway,</l>
    <l>'I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.'&quot;</l>
    <l>And I replied as was imposed on me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,</l>
    <l>Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation</l>
    <l>Said to me: &quot;Then what wantest thou of me?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If who I am thou carest so much to know,</l>
    <l>That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,</l>
    <l>Know that I vested was with the great mantle;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And truly was I son of the She-bear,</l>
    <l>So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth</l>
    <l>Above, and here myself, I pocketed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Beneath my head the others are dragged down</l>
    <l>Who have preceded me in simony,</l>
    <l>Flattened along the fissure of the rock.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever</l>
    <l>That one shall come who I believed thou wast,</l>
    <l>What time the sudden question I proposed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But longer I my feet already toast,</l>
    <l>And here have been in this way upside down,</l>
    <l>Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For after him shall come of fouler deed</l>
    <l>From tow'rds the west a Pastor without law,</l>
    <l>Such as befits to cover him and me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>New Jason will he be, of whom we read</l>
    <l>In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,</l>
    <l>So he who governs France shall be to this one.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I do not know if I were here too bold,</l>
    <l>That him I answered only in this metre:</l>
    <l>&quot;I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,</l>
    <l>Before he put the keys into his keeping?</l>
    <l>Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias</l>
    <l>Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen</l>
    <l>Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,</l>
    <l>And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,</l>
    <l>Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And were it not that still forbids it me</l>
    <l>The reverence for the keys superlative</l>
    <l>Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I would make use of words more grievous still;</l>
    <l>Because your avarice afflicts the world,</l>
    <l>Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,</l>
    <l>When she who sitteth upon many waters</l>
    <l>To fornicate with kings by him was seen;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The same who with the seven heads was born,</l>
    <l>And power and strength from the ten horns received,</l>
    <l>So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;</l>
    <l>And from the idolater how differ ye,</l>
    <l>Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,</l>
    <l>Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower</l>
    <l>Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And while I sang to him such notes as these,</l>
    <l>Either that anger or that conscience stung him,</l>
    <l>He struggled violently with both his feet.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,</l>
    <l>With such contented lip he listened ever</l>
    <l>Unto the sound of the true words expressed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore with both his arms he took me up,</l>
    <l>And when he had me all upon his breast,</l>
    <l>Remounted by the way where he descended.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;</l>
    <l>But bore me to the summit of the arch</l>
    <l>Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There tenderly he laid his burden down,</l>
    <l>Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,</l>
    <l>That would have been hard passage for the goats:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thence was unveiled to me another valley.</l>
