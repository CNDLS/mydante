  <p>
    <l>Day was departing, and the embrowned air</l>
    <l>Released the animals that are on earth</l>
    <l>From their fatigues; and I the only one</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Made myself ready to sustain the war,</l>
    <l>Both of the way and likewise of the woe,</l>
    <l>Which memory that errs not shall retrace.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!</l>
    <l>O memory, that didst write down what I saw,</l>
    <l>Here thy nobility shall be manifest!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I began: &quot;Poet, who guidest me,</l>
    <l>Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,</l>
    <l>Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,</l>
    <l>While yet corruptible, unto the world</l>
    <l>Immortal went, and was there bodily.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But if the adversary of all evil</l>
    <l>Was courteous, thinking of the high effect</l>
    <l>That issue would from him, and who, and what,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;</l>
    <l>For he was of great Rome, and of her empire</l>
    <l>In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,</l>
    <l>Were stablished as the holy place, wherein</l>
    <l>Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,</l>
    <l>Things did he hear, which the occasion were</l>
    <l>Both of his victory and the papal mantle.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,</l>
    <l>To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,</l>
    <l>Which of salvation's way is the beginning.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?</l>
    <l>I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,</l>
    <l>Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore, if I resign myself to come,</l>
    <l>I fear the coming may be ill-advised;</l>
    <l>Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as he is, who unwills what he willed,</l>
    <l>And by new thoughts doth his intention change,</l>
    <l>So that from his design he quite withdraws,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such I became, upon that dark hillside,</l>
    <l>Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,</l>
    <l>Which was so very prompt in the beginning.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;If I have well thy language understood,&quot;</l>
    <l>Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,</l>
    <l>&quot;Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Which many times a man encumbers so,</l>
    <l>It turns him back from honoured enterprise,</l>
    <l>As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,</l>
    <l>I'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard</l>
    <l>At the first moment when I grieved for thee.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Among those was I who are in suspense,</l>
    <l>And a fair, saintly Lady called to me</l>
    <l>In such wise, I besought her to command me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;</l>
    <l>And she began to say, gentle and low,</l>
    <l>With voice angelical, in her own language:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'O spirit courteous of Mantua,</l>
    <l>Of whom the fame still in the world endures,</l>
    <l>And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,</l>
    <l>Upon the desert slope is so impeded</l>
    <l>Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And may, I fear, already be so lost,</l>
    <l>That I too late have risen to his succour,</l>
    <l>From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,</l>
    <l>And with what needful is for his release,</l>
    <l>Assist him so, that I may be consoled.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;</l>
    <l>I come from there, where I would fain return;</l>
    <l>Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When I shall be in presence of my Lord,</l>
    <l>Full often will I praise thee unto him.'</l>
    <l>Then paused she, and thereafter I began:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom</l>
    <l>The human race exceedeth all contained</l>
    <l>Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So grateful unto me is thy commandment,</l>
    <l>To obey, if 'twere already done, were late;</l>
    <l>No farther need'st thou ope to me thy wish.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun</l>
    <l>The here descending down into this centre,</l>
    <l>From the vast place thou burnest to return to.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,</l>
    <l>Briefly will I relate,' she answered me,</l>
    <l>'Why I am not afraid to enter here.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of those things only should one be afraid</l>
    <l>Which have the power of doing others harm;</l>
    <l>Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>God in his mercy such created me</l>
    <l>That misery of yours attains me not,</l>
    <l>Nor any flame assails me of this burning.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves</l>
    <l>At this impediment, to which I send thee,</l>
    <l>So that stern judgment there above is broken.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In her entreaty she besought Lucia,</l>
    <l>And said, &quot;Thy faithful one now stands in need</l>
    <l>Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,</l>
    <l>Hastened away, and came unto the place</l>
    <l>Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Beatrice&quot; said she, &quot;the true praise of God,</l>
    <l>Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,</l>
    <l>For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?</l>
    <l>Dost thou not see the death that combats him</l>
    <l>Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Never were persons in the world so swift</l>
    <l>To work their weal and to escape their woe,</l>
    <l>As I, after such words as these were uttered,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Came hither downward from my blessed seat,</l>
    <l>Confiding in thy dignified discourse,</l>
    <l>Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After she thus had spoken unto me,</l>
    <l>Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;</l>
    <l>Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And unto thee I came, as she desired;</l>
    <l>I have delivered thee from that wild beast,</l>
    <l>Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>What is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?</l>
    <l>Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?</l>
    <l>Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Seeing that three such Ladies benedight</l>
    <l>Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,</l>
    <l>And so much good my speech doth promise thee?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,</l>
    <l>Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,</l>
    <l>Uplift themselves all open on their stems;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such I became with my exhausted strength,</l>
    <l>And such good courage to my heart there coursed,</l>
    <l>That I began, like an intrepid person:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O she compassionate, who succoured me,</l>
    <l>And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon</l>
    <l>The words of truth which she addressed to thee!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed</l>
    <l>To the adventure, with these words of thine,</l>
    <l>That to my first intent I have returned.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now go, for one sole will is in us both,</l>
    <l>Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.&quot;</l>
    <l>Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I entered on the deep and savage way.</l>
