  <p>
    <l>In that part of the youthful year wherein</l>
    <l>The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,</l>
    <l>And now the nights draw near to half the day,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground</l>
    <l>The outward semblance of her sister white,</l>
    <l>But little lasts the temper of her pen,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,</l>
    <l>Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign</l>
    <l>All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Returns in doors, and up and down laments,</l>
    <l>Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;</l>
    <l>Then he returns and hope revives again,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Seeing the world has changed its countenance</l>
    <l>In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook,</l>
    <l>And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,</l>
    <l>When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,</l>
    <l>And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For as we came unto the ruined bridge,</l>
    <l>The Leader turned to me with that sweet look</l>
    <l>Which at the mountain's foot I first beheld.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>His arms he opened, after some advisement</l>
    <l>Within himself elected, looking first</l>
    <l>Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And even as he who acts and meditates,</l>
    <l>For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,</l>
    <l>So upward lifting me towards the summit</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,</l>
    <l>Saying: &quot;To that one grapple afterwards,</l>
    <l>But try first if 'tis such that it will hold thee.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;</l>
    <l>For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,</l>
    <l>Were able to ascend from jag to jag.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And had it not been, that upon that precinct</l>
    <l>Shorter was the ascent than on the other,</l>
    <l>He I know not, but I had been dead beat.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth</l>
    <l>Of the profoundest well is all inclining,</l>
    <l>The structure of each valley doth import</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That one bank rises and the other sinks.</l>
    <l>Still we arrived at length upon the point</l>
    <l>Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The breath was from my lungs so milked away,</l>
    <l>When I was up, that I could go no farther,</l>
    <l>Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,&quot;</l>
    <l>My Master said; &quot;for sitting upon down,</l>
    <l>Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Withouten which whoso his life consumes</l>
    <l>Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,</l>
    <l>As smoke in air or in the water foam.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And therefore raise thee up, o'ercome the anguish</l>
    <l>With spirit that o'ercometh every battle,</l>
    <l>If with its heavy body it sink not.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;</l>
    <l>'Tis not enough from these to have departed;</l>
    <l>Let it avail thee, if thou understand me.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then I uprose, showing myself provided</l>
    <l>Better with breath than I did feel myself,</l>
    <l>And said: &quot;Go on, for I am strong and bold.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upward we took our way along the crag,</l>
    <l>Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,</l>
    <l>And more precipitous far than that before.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;</l>
    <l>Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,</l>
    <l>Not well adapted to articulate words.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I know not what it said, though o'er the back</l>
    <l>I now was of the arch that passes there;</l>
    <l>But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I was bent downward, but my living eyes</l>
    <l>Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;</l>
    <l>Wherefore I: &quot;Master, see that thou arrive</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>At the next round, and let us descend the wall;</l>
    <l>For as from hence I hear and understand not,</l>
    <l>So I look down and nothing I distinguish.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Other response,&quot; he said, &quot;I make thee not,</l>
    <l>Except the doing; for the modest asking</l>
    <l>Ought to be followed by the deed in silence.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We from the bridge descended at its head,</l>
    <l>Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,</l>
    <l>And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I beheld therein a terrible throng</l>
    <l>Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,</l>
    <l>That the remembrance still congeals my blood</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;</l>
    <l>For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae</l>
    <l>She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Neither so many plagues nor so malignant</l>
    <l>E'er showed she with all Ethiopia,</l>
    <l>Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Among this cruel and most dismal throng</l>
    <l>People were running naked and affrighted.</l>
    <l>Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;</l>
    <l>These riveted upon their reins the tail</l>
    <l>And head, and were in front of them entwined.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And lo! at one who was upon our side</l>
    <l>There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him</l>
    <l>There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written,</l>
    <l>As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly</l>
    <l>Behoved it that in falling he became.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,</l>
    <l>The ashes drew together, and of themselves</l>
    <l>Into himself they instantly returned.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed</l>
    <l>The phoenix dies, and then is born again,</l>
    <l>When it approaches its five-hundredth year;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,</l>
    <l>But only on tears of incense and amomum,</l>
    <l>And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as he is who falls, and knows not how,</l>
    <l>By force of demons who to earth down drag him,</l>
    <l>Or other oppilation that binds man,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When he arises and around him looks,</l>
    <l>Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish</l>
    <l>Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such was that sinner after he had risen.</l>
    <l>Justice of God! O how severe it is,</l>
    <l>That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;</l>
    <l>Whence he replied: &quot;I rained from Tuscany</l>
    <l>A short time since into this cruel gorge.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,</l>
    <l>Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci,</l>
    <l>Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I unto the Guide: &quot;Tell him to stir not,</l>
    <l>And ask what crime has thrust him here below,</l>
    <l>For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,</l>
    <l>But unto me directed mind and face,</l>
    <l>And with a melancholy shame was painted.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then said: &quot;It pains me more that thou hast caught me</l>
    <l>Amid this misery where thou seest me,</l>
    <l>Than when I from the other life was taken.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>What thou demandest I cannot deny;</l>
    <l>So low am I put down because I robbed</l>
    <l>The sacristy of the fair ornaments,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And falsely once 'twas laid upon another;</l>
    <l>But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,</l>
    <l>If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:</l>
    <l>Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;</l>
    <l>Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,</l>
    <l>Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,</l>
    <l>And with impetuous and bitter tempest</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;</l>
    <l>When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,</l>
    <l>So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And this I've said that it may give thee pain.&quot;</l>
