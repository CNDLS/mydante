  <p>
    <l>Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,</l>
    <l>That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,</l>
    <l>And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Among the thieves five citizens of thine</l>
    <l>Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,</l>
    <l>And thou thereby to no great honour risest.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But if when morn is near our dreams are true,</l>
    <l>Feel shalt thou in a little time from now</l>
    <l>What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if it now were, it were not too soon;</l>
    <l>Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,</l>
    <l>For 'twill aggrieve me more the more I age.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We went our way, and up along the stairs</l>
    <l>The bourns had made us to descend before,</l>
    <l>Remounted my Conductor and drew me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And following the solitary path</l>
    <l>Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,</l>
    <l>The foot without the hand sped not at all.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,</l>
    <l>When I direct my mind to what I saw,</l>
    <l>And more my genius curb than I am wont,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That it may run not unless virtue guide it;</l>
    <l>So that if some good star, or better thing,</l>
    <l>Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As many as the hind (who on the hill</l>
    <l>Rests at the time when he who lights the world</l>
    <l>His countenance keeps least concealed from us,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)</l>
    <l>Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,</l>
    <l>Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With flames as manifold resplendent all</l>
    <l>Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware</l>
    <l>As soon as I was where the depth appeared.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And such as he who with the bears avenged him</l>
    <l>Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing,</l>
    <l>What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For with his eye he could not follow it</l>
    <l>So as to see aught else than flame alone,</l>
    <l>Even as a little cloud ascending upward,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment</l>
    <l>Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,</l>
    <l>And every flame a sinner steals away.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,</l>
    <l>So that, if I had seized not on a rock,</l>
    <l>Down had I fallen without being pushed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,</l>
    <l>Exclaimed: &quot;Within the fires the spirits are;</l>
    <l>Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;My Master,&quot; I replied, &quot;by hearing thee</l>
    <l>I am more sure; but I surmised already</l>
    <l>It might be so, and already wished to ask thee</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft</l>
    <l>At top, it seems uprising from the pyre</l>
    <l>Where was Eteocles with his brother placed.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He answered me: &quot;Within there are tormented</l>
    <l>Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together</l>
    <l>They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And there within their flame do they lament</l>
    <l>The ambush of the horse, which made the door</l>
    <l>Whence issued forth the Romans' gentle seed;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead</l>
    <l>Deidamia still deplores Achilles,</l>
    <l>And pain for the Palladium there is borne.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;If they within those sparks possess the power</l>
    <l>To speak,&quot; I said, &quot;thee, Master, much I pray,</l>
    <l>And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That thou make no denial of awaiting</l>
    <l>Until the horned flame shall hither come;</l>
    <l>Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;Worthy is thy entreaty</l>
    <l>Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;</l>
    <l>But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Leave me to speak, because I have conceived</l>
    <l>That which thou wishest; for they might disdain</l>
    <l>Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When now the flame had come unto that point,</l>
    <l>Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,</l>
    <l>After this fashion did I hear him speak:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O ye, who are twofold within one fire,</l>
    <l>If I deserved of you, while I was living,</l>
    <l>If I deserved of you or much or little</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,</l>
    <l>Do not move on, but one of you declare</l>
    <l>Whither, being lost, he went away to die.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then of the antique flame the greater horn,</l>
    <l>Murmuring, began to wave itself about</l>
    <l>Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereafterward, the summit to and fro</l>
    <l>Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,</l>
    <l>It uttered forth a voice, and said: &quot;When I</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From Circe had departed, who concealed me</l>
    <l>More than a year there near unto Gaeta,</l>
    <l>Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence</l>
    <l>For my old father, nor the due affection</l>
    <l>Which joyous should have made Penelope,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Could overcome within me the desire</l>
    <l>I had to be experienced of the world,</l>
    <l>And of the vice and virtue of mankind;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But I put forth on the high open sea</l>
    <l>With one sole ship, and that small company</l>
    <l>By which I never had deserted been.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,</l>
    <l>Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,</l>
    <l>And the others which that sea bathes round about.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I and my company were old and slow</l>
    <l>When at that narrow passage we arrived</l>
    <l>Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That man no farther onward should adventure.</l>
    <l>On the right hand behind me left I Seville,</l>
    <l>And on the other already had left Ceuta.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand</l>
    <l>Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West,</l>
    <l>To this so inconsiderable vigil</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Which is remaining of your senses still</l>
    <l>Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,</l>
    <l>Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;</l>
    <l>Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,</l>
    <l>But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So eager did I render my companions,</l>
    <l>With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,</l>
    <l>That then I hardly could have held them back.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And having turned our stern unto the morning,</l>
    <l>We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,</l>
    <l>Evermore gaining on the larboard side.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Already all the stars of the other pole</l>
    <l>The night beheld, and ours so very low</l>
    <l>It did not rise above the ocean floor.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Five times rekindled and as many quenched</l>
    <l>Had been the splendour underneath the moon,</l>
    <l>Since we had entered into the deep pass,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When there appeared to us a mountain, dim</l>
    <l>From distance, and it seemed to me so high</l>
    <l>As I had never any one beheld.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;</l>
    <l>For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,</l>
    <l>And smote upon the fore part of the ship.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,</l>
    <l>At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,</l>
    <l>And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Until the sea above us closed again.&quot;</l>
