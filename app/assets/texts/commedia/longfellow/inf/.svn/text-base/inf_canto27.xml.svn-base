  <p>
    <l>Already was the flame erect and quiet,</l>
    <l>To speak no more, and now departed from us</l>
    <l>With the permission of the gentle Poet;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When yet another, which behind it came,</l>
    <l>Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top</l>
    <l>By a confused sound that issued from it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first</l>
    <l>With the lament of him, and that was right,</l>
    <l>Who with his file had modulated it)</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,</l>
    <l>That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,</l>
    <l>Still it appeared with agony transfixed;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus, by not having any way or issue</l>
    <l>At first from out the fire, to its own language</l>
    <l>Converted were the melancholy words.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But afterwards, when they had gathered way</l>
    <l>Up through the point, giving it that vibration</l>
    <l>The tongue had given them in their passage out,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We heard it said: &quot;O thou, at whom I aim</l>
    <l>My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,</l>
    <l>Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because I come perchance a little late,</l>
    <l>To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;</l>
    <l>Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If thou but lately into this blind world</l>
    <l>Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,</l>
    <l>Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,</l>
    <l>For I was from the mountains there between</l>
    <l>Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I still was downward bent and listening,</l>
    <l>When my Conductor touched me on the side,</l>
    <l>Saying: &quot;Speak thou: this one a Latian is.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I, who had beforehand my reply</l>
    <l>In readiness, forthwith began to speak:</l>
    <l>&quot;O soul, that down below there art concealed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Romagna thine is not and never has been</l>
    <l>Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;</l>
    <l>But open war I none have left there now.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;</l>
    <l>The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,</l>
    <l>So that she covers Cervia with her vans.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The city which once made the long resistance,</l>
    <l>And of the French a sanguinary heap,</l>
    <l>Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Verrucchio's ancient Mastiff and the new,</l>
    <l>Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,</l>
    <l>Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The cities of Lamone and Santerno</l>
    <l>Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,</l>
    <l>Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,</l>
    <l>Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,</l>
    <l>Lives between tyranny and a free state.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;</l>
    <l>Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,</l>
    <l>So may thy name hold front there in the world.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After the fire a little more had roared</l>
    <l>In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved</l>
    <l>This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;If I believed that my reply were made</l>
    <l>To one who to the world would e'er return,</l>
    <l>This flame without more flickering would stand still;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But inasmuch as never from this depth</l>
    <l>Did any one return, if I hear true,</l>
    <l>Without the fear of infamy I answer,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,</l>
    <l>Believing thus begirt to make amends;</l>
    <l>And truly my belief had been fulfilled</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,</l>
    <l>Who put me back into my former sins;</l>
    <l>And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>While I was still the form of bone and pulp</l>
    <l>My mother gave to me, the deeds I did</l>
    <l>Were not those of a lion, but a fox.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The machinations and the covert ways</l>
    <l>I knew them all, and practised so their craft,</l>
    <l>That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When now unto that portion of mine age</l>
    <l>I saw myself arrived, when each one ought</l>
    <l>To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That which before had pleased me then displeased me;</l>
    <l>And penitent and confessing I surrendered,</l>
    <l>Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Leader of the modern Pharisees</l>
    <l>Having a war near unto Lateran,</l>
    <l>And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For each one of his enemies was Christian,</l>
    <l>And none of them had been to conquer Acre,</l>
    <l>Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,</l>
    <l>In him regarded, nor in me that cord</l>
    <l>Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester</l>
    <l>To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,</l>
    <l>So this one sought me out as an adept</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To cure him of the fever of his pride.</l>
    <l>Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,</l>
    <l>Because his words appeared inebriate.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid;</l>
    <l>Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me</l>
    <l>How to raze Palestrina to the ground.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,</l>
    <l>As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,</l>
    <l>The which my predecessor held not dear.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then urged me on his weighty arguments</l>
    <l>There, where my silence was the worst advice;</l>
    <l>And said I: 'Father, since thou washest me</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of that sin into which I now must fall,</l>
    <l>The promise long with the fulfilment short</l>
    <l>Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Francis came afterward, when I was dead,</l>
    <l>For me; but one of the black Cherubim</l>
    <l>Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He must come down among my servitors,</l>
    <l>Because he gave the fraudulent advice</l>
    <l>From which time forth I have been at his hair;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For who repents not cannot be absolved,</l>
    <l>Nor can one both repent and will at once,</l>
    <l>Because of the contradiction which consents not.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O miserable me! how I did shudder</l>
    <l>When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure</l>
    <l>Thou didst not think that I was a logician!'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He bore me unto Minos, who entwined</l>
    <l>Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,</l>
    <l>And after he had bitten it in great rage,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;'</l>
    <l>Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,</l>
    <l>And vested thus in going I bemoan me.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When it had thus completed its recital,</l>
    <l>The flame departed uttering lamentations,</l>
    <l>Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,</l>
    <l>Up o'er the crag above another arch,</l>
    <l>Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>By those who, sowing discord, win their burden.</l>
