    <l>The many people and the divers wounds</l>
    <l>These eyes of mine had so inebriated,</l>
    <l>That they were wishful to stand still and weep;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But said Virgilius: &quot;What dost thou still gaze at?</l>
    <l>Why is thy sight still riveted down there</l>
    <l>Among the mournful, mutilated shades?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;</l>
    <l>Consider, if to count them thou believest,</l>
    <l>That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And now the moon is underneath our feet;</l>
    <l>Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,</l>
    <l>And more is to be seen than what thou seest.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;If thou hadst,&quot; I made answer thereupon,</l>
    <l>&quot;Attended to the cause for which I looked,</l>
    <l>Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him</l>
    <l>I went, already making my reply,</l>
    <l>And superadding: &quot;In that cavern where</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,</l>
    <l>I think a spirit of my blood laments</l>
    <l>The sin which down below there costs so much.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then said the Master: &quot;Be no longer broken</l>
    <l>Thy thought from this time forward upon him;</l>
    <l>Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For him I saw below the little bridge,</l>
    <l>Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger</l>
    <l>Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So wholly at that time wast thou impeded</l>
    <l>By him who formerly held Altaforte,</l>
    <l>Thou didst not look that way; so he departed.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O my Conductor, his own violent death,</l>
    <l>Which is not yet avenged for him,&quot; I said,</l>
    <l>&quot;By any who is sharer in the shame,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Made him disdainful; whence he went away,</l>
    <l>As I imagine, without speaking to me,</l>
    <l>And thereby made me pity him the more.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus did we speak as far as the first place</l>
    <l>Upon the crag, which the next valley shows</l>
    <l>Down to the bottom, if there were more light.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When we were now right over the last cloister</l>
    <l>Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers</l>
    <l>Could manifest themselves unto our sight,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,</l>
    <l>Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,</l>
    <l>Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>What pain would be, if from the hospitals</l>
    <l>Of Valdichiana, 'twixt July and September,</l>
    <l>And of Maremma and Sardinia</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>All the diseases in one moat were gathered,</l>
    <l>Such was it here, and such a stench came from it</l>
    <l>As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We had descended on the furthest bank</l>
    <l>From the long crag, upon the left hand still,</l>
    <l>And then more vivid was my power of sight</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress</l>
    <l>Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,</l>
    <l>Punishes forgers, which she here records.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I do not think a sadder sight to see</l>
    <l>Was in Aegina the whole people sick,</l>
    <l>(When was the air so full of pestilence,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The animals, down to the little worm,</l>
    <l>All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,</l>
    <l>According as the poets have affirmed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Were from the seed of ants restored again,)</l>
    <l>Than was it to behold through that dark valley</l>
    <l>The spirits languishing in divers heaps.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This on the belly, that upon the back</l>
    <l>One of the other lay, and others crawling</l>
    <l>Shifted themselves along the dismal road.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We step by step went onward without speech,</l>
    <l>Gazing upon and listening to the sick</l>
    <l>Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw two sitting leaned against each other,</l>
    <l>As leans in heating platter against platter,</l>
    <l>From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And never saw I plied a currycomb</l>
    <l>By stable-boy for whom his master waits,</l>
    <l>Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As every one was plying fast the bite</l>
    <l>Of nails upon himself, for the great rage</l>
    <l>Of itching which no other succour had.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,</l>
    <l>In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,</l>
    <l>Or any other fish that has them largest.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,&quot;</l>
    <l>Began my Leader unto one of them,</l>
    <l>&quot;And makest of them pincers now and then,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Tell me if any Latian is with those</l>
    <l>Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee</l>
    <l>To all eternity unto this work.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,</l>
    <l>Both of us here,&quot; one weeping made reply;</l>
    <l>&quot;But who art thou, that questionest about us?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And said the Guide: &quot;One am I who descends</l>
    <l>Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,</l>
    <l>And I intend to show Hell unto him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then broken was their mutual support,</l>
    <l>And trembling each one turned himself to me,</l>
    <l>With others who had heard him by rebound.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Wholly to me did the good Master gather,</l>
    <l>Saying: &quot;Say unto them whate'er thou wishest.&quot;</l>
    <l>And I began, since he would have it so:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;So may your memory not steal away</l>
    <l>In the first world from out the minds of men,</l>
    <l>But so may it survive 'neath many suns,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Say to me who ye are, and of what people;</l>
    <l>Let not your foul and loathsome punishment</l>
    <l>Make you afraid to show yourselves to me.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;I of Arezzo was,&quot; one made reply,</l>
    <l>&quot;And Albert of Siena had me burned;</l>
    <l>But what I died for does not bring me here.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,</l>
    <l>That I could rise by flight into the air,</l>
    <l>And he who had conceit, but little wit,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Would have me show to him the art; and only</l>
    <l>Because no Daedalus I made him, made me</l>
    <l>Be burned by one who held him as his son.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,</l>
    <l>For alchemy, which in the world I practised,</l>
    <l>Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And to the Poet said I: &quot;Now was ever</l>
    <l>So vain a people as the Sienese?</l>
    <l>Not for a certainty the French by far.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,</l>
    <l>Replied unto my speech: &quot;Taking out Stricca,</l>
    <l>Who knew the art of moderate expenses,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And Niccolo, who the luxurious use</l>
    <l>Of cloves discovered earliest of all</l>
    <l>Within that garden where such seed takes root;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And taking out the band, among whom squandered</l>
    <l>Caccia d'Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,</l>
    <l>And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But, that thou know who thus doth second thee</l>
    <l>Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye</l>
    <l>Tow'rds me, so that my face well answer thee,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And thou shalt see I am Capocchio's shade,</l>
    <l>Who metals falsified by alchemy;</l>
    <l>Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>How I a skilful ape of nature was.&quot;</l>
