    <l>&quot;Through me the way is to the city dolent;</l>
    <l>Through me the way is to eternal dole;</l>
    <l>Through me the way among the people lost.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Justice incited my sublime Creator;</l>
    <l>Created me divine Omnipotence,</l>
    <l>The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Before me there were no created things,</l>
    <l>Only eterne, and I eternal last.</l>
    <l>All hope abandon, ye who enter in!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>These words in sombre colour I beheld</l>
    <l>Written upon the summit of a gate;</l>
    <l>Whence I: &quot;Their sense is, Master, hard to me!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me, as one experienced:</l>
    <l>&quot;Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,</l>
    <l>All cowardice must needs be here extinct.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We to the place have come, where I have told thee</l>
    <l>Thou shalt behold the people dolorous</l>
    <l>Who have foregone the good of intellect.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And after he had laid his hand on mine</l>
    <l>With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,</l>
    <l>He led me in among the secret things.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud</l>
    <l>Resounded through the air without a star,</l>
    <l>Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Languages diverse, horrible dialects,</l>
    <l>Accents of anger, words of agony,</l>
    <l>And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Made up a tumult that goes whirling on</l>
    <l>For ever in that air for ever black,</l>
    <l>Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I, who had my head with horror bound,</l>
    <l>Said: &quot;Master, what is this which now I hear?</l>
    <l>What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;This miserable mode</l>
    <l>Maintain the melancholy souls of those</l>
    <l>Who lived withouten infamy or praise.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Commingled are they with that caitiff choir</l>
    <l>Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,</l>
    <l>Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;</l>
    <l>Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,</l>
    <l>For glory none the damned would have from them.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I: &quot;O Master, what so grievous is</l>
    <l>To these, that maketh them lament so sore?&quot;</l>
    <l>He answered: &quot;I will tell thee very briefly.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>These have no longer any hope of death;</l>
    <l>And this blind life of theirs is so debased,</l>
    <l>They envious are of every other fate.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>No fame of them the world permits to be;</l>
    <l>Misericord and Justice both disdain them.</l>
    <l>Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,</l>
    <l>Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,</l>
    <l>That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And after it there came so long a train</l>
    <l>Of people, that I ne'er would have believed</l>
    <l>That ever Death so many had undone.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When some among them I had recognised,</l>
    <l>I looked, and I beheld the shade of him</l>
    <l>Who made through cowardice the great refusal.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,</l>
    <l>That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches</l>
    <l>Hateful to God and to his enemies.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>These miscreants, who never were alive,</l>
    <l>Were naked, and were stung exceedingly</l>
    <l>By gadflies and by hornets that were there.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>These did their faces irrigate with blood,</l>
    <l>Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet</l>
    <l>By the disgusting worms was gathered up.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And when to gazing farther I betook me.</l>
    <l>People I saw on a great river's bank;</l>
    <l>Whence said I: &quot;Master, now vouchsafe to me,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That I may know who these are, and what law</l>
    <l>Makes them appear so ready to pass over,</l>
    <l>As I discern athwart the dusky light.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;These things shall all be known</l>
    <l>To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay</l>
    <l>Upon the dismal shore of Acheron.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,</l>
    <l>Fearing my words might irksome be to him,</l>
    <l>From speech refrained I till we reached the river.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And lo! towards us coming in a boat</l>
    <l>An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,</l>
    <l>Crying: &quot;Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;</l>
    <l>I come to lead you to the other shore,</l>
    <l>To the eternal shades in heat and frost.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,</l>
    <l>Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!&quot;</l>
    <l>But when he saw that I did not withdraw,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He said: &quot;By other ways, by other ports</l>
    <l>Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;</l>
    <l>A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And unto him the Guide: &quot;Vex thee not, Charon;</l>
    <l>It is so willed there where is power to do</l>
    <l>That which is willed; and farther question not.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks</l>
    <l>Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,</l>
    <l>Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But all those souls who weary were and naked</l>
    <l>Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,</l>
    <l>As soon as they had heard those cruel words.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>God they blasphemed and their progenitors,</l>
    <l>The human race, the place, the time, the seed</l>
    <l>Of their engendering and of their birth!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereafter all together they drew back,</l>
    <l>Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,</l>
    <l>Which waiteth every man who fears not God.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,</l>
    <l>Beckoning to them, collects them all together,</l>
    <l>Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,</l>
    <l>First one and then another, till the branch</l>
    <l>Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In similar wise the evil seed of Adam</l>
    <l>Throw themselves from that margin one by one,</l>
    <l>At signals, as a bird unto its lure.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So they depart across the dusky wave,</l>
    <l>And ere upon the other side they land,</l>
    <l>Again on this side a new troop assembles.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;My son,&quot; the courteous Master said to me,</l>
    <l>&quot;All those who perish in the wrath of God</l>
    <l>Here meet together out of every land;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And ready are they to pass o'er the river,</l>
    <l>Because celestial Justice spurs them on,</l>
    <l>So that their fear is turned into desire.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This way there never passes a good soul;</l>
    <l>And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,</l>
    <l>Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This being finished, all the dusk champaign</l>
    <l>Trembled so violently, that of that terror</l>
    <l>The recollection bathes me still with sweat.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,</l>
    <l>And fulminated a vermilion light,</l>
    <l>Which overmastered in me every sense,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.</l>
