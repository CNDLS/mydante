    <l>&quot;'Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni'</l>
    <l>Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,&quot;</l>
    <l>My Master said, &quot;if thou discernest him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when</l>
    <l>Our hemisphere is darkening into night,</l>
    <l>Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Methought that such a building then I saw;</l>
    <l>And, for the wind, I drew myself behind</l>
    <l>My Guide, because there was no other shelter.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,</l>
    <l>There where the shades were wholly covered up,</l>
    <l>And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Some prone are lying, others stand erect,</l>
    <l>This with the head, and that one with the soles;</l>
    <l>Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When in advance so far we had proceeded,</l>
    <l>That it my Master pleased to show to me</l>
    <l>The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He from before me moved and made me stop,</l>
    <l>Saying: &quot;Behold Dis, and behold the place</l>
    <l>Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>How frozen I became and powerless then,</l>
    <l>Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,</l>
    <l>Because all language would be insufficient.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I did not die, and I alive remained not;</l>
    <l>Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,</l>
    <l>What I became, being of both deprived.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous</l>
    <l>From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;</l>
    <l>And better with a giant I compare</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Than do the giants with those arms of his;</l>
    <l>Consider now how great must be that whole,</l>
    <l>Which unto such a part conforms itself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,</l>
    <l>And lifted up his brow against his Maker,</l>
    <l>Well may proceed from him all tribulation.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O, what a marvel it appeared to me,</l>
    <l>When I beheld three faces on his head!</l>
    <l>The one in front, and that vermilion was;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Two were the others, that were joined with this</l>
    <l>Above the middle part of either shoulder,</l>
    <l>And they were joined together at the crest;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow;</l>
    <l>The left was such to look upon as those</l>
    <l>Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,</l>
    <l>Such as befitting were so great a bird;</l>
    <l>Sails of the sea I never saw so large.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>No feathers had they, but as of a bat</l>
    <l>Their fashion was; and he was waving them,</l>
    <l>So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.</l>
    <l>With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins</l>
    <l>Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching</l>
    <l>A sinner, in the manner of a brake,</l>
    <l>So that he three of them tormented thus.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To him in front the biting was as naught</l>
    <l>Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine</l>
    <l>Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;That soul up there which has the greatest pain,&quot;</l>
    <l>The Master said, &quot;is Judas Iscariot;</l>
    <l>With head inside, he plies his legs without.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of the two others, who head downward are,</l>
    <l>The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;</l>
    <l>See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.</l>
    <l>But night is reascending, and 'tis time</l>
    <l>That we depart, for we have seen the whole.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,</l>
    <l>And he the vantage seized of time and place,</l>
    <l>And when the wings were opened wide apart,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;</l>
    <l>From fell to fell descended downward then</l>
    <l>Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When we were come to where the thigh revolves</l>
    <l>Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,</l>
    <l>The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Turned round his head where he had had his legs,</l>
    <l>And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,</l>
    <l>So that to Hell I thought we were returning.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,&quot;</l>
    <l>The Master said, panting as one fatigued,</l>
    <l>&quot;Must we perforce depart from so much evil.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then through the opening of a rock he issued,</l>
    <l>And down upon the margin seated me;</l>
    <l>Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see</l>
    <l>Lucifer in the same way I had left him;</l>
    <l>And I beheld him upward hold his legs.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if I then became disquieted,</l>
    <l>Let stolid people think who do not see</l>
    <l>What the point is beyond which I had passed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Rise up,&quot; the Master said, &quot;upon thy feet;</l>
    <l>The way is long, and difficult the road,</l>
    <l>And now the sun to middle-tierce returns.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It was not any palace corridor</l>
    <l>There where we were, but dungeon natural,</l>
    <l>With floor uneven and unease of light.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,</l>
    <l>My Master,&quot; said I when I had arisen,</l>
    <l>&quot;To draw me from an error speak a little;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed</l>
    <l>Thus upside down? and how in such short time</l>
    <l>From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;Thou still imaginest</l>
    <l>Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped</l>
    <l>The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That side thou wast, so long as I descended;</l>
    <l>When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point</l>
    <l>To which things heavy draw from every side,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And now beneath the hemisphere art come</l>
    <l>Opposite that which overhangs the vast</l>
    <l>Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Man who without sin was born and lived.</l>
    <l>Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere</l>
    <l>Which makes the other face of the Judecca.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Here it is morn when it is evening there;</l>
    <l>And he who with his hair a stairway made us</l>
    <l>Still fixed remaineth as he was before.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;</l>
    <l>And all the land, that whilom here emerged,</l>
    <l>For fear of him made of the sea a veil,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure</l>
    <l>To flee from him, what on this side appears</l>
    <l>Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A place there is below, from Beelzebub</l>
    <l>As far receding as the tomb extends,</l>
    <l>Which not by sight is known, but by the sound</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth</l>
    <l>Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed</l>
    <l>With course that winds about and slightly falls.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Guide and I into that hidden road</l>
    <l>Now entered, to return to the bright world;</l>
    <l>And without care of having any rest</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We mounted up, he first and I the second,</l>
    <l>Till I beheld through a round aperture</l>
    <l>Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.</l>
