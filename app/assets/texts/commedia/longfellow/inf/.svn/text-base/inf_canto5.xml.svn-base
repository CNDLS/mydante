  <p>
    <l>Thus I descended out of the first circle</l>
    <l>Down to the second, that less space begirds,</l>
    <l>And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;</l>
    <l>Examines the transgressions at the entrance;</l>
    <l>Judges, and sends according as he girds him.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I say, that when the spirit evil-born</l>
    <l>Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;</l>
    <l>And this discriminator of transgressions</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;</l>
    <l>Girds himself with his tail as many times</l>
    <l>As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Always before him many of them stand;</l>
    <l>They go by turns each one unto the judgment;</l>
    <l>They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry</l>
    <l>Comest,&quot; said Minos to me, when he saw me,</l>
    <l>Leaving the practice of so great an office,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;</l>
    <l>Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee.&quot;</l>
    <l>And unto him my Guide: &quot;Why criest thou too?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;</l>
    <l>It is so willed there where is power to do</l>
    <l>That which is willed; and ask no further question.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And now begin the dolesome notes to grow</l>
    <l>Audible unto me; now am I come</l>
    <l>There where much lamentation strikes upon me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I came into a place mute of all light,</l>
    <l>Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,</l>
    <l>If by opposing winds 't is combated.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The infernal hurricane that never rests</l>
    <l>Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;</l>
    <l>Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When they arrive before the precipice,</l>
    <l>There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,</l>
    <l>There they blaspheme the puissance divine.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I understood that unto such a torment</l>
    <l>The carnal malefactors were condemned,</l>
    <l>Who reason subjugate to appetite.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as the wings of starlings bear them on</l>
    <l>In the cold season in large band and full,</l>
    <l>So doth that blast the spirits maledict;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;</l>
    <l>No hope doth comfort them for evermore,</l>
    <l>Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,</l>
    <l>Making in air a long line of themselves,</l>
    <l>So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.</l>
    <l>Whereupon said I: &quot;Master, who are those</l>
    <l>People, whom the black air so castigates?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;The first of those, of whom intelligence</l>
    <l>Thou fain wouldst have,&quot; then said he unto me,</l>
    <l>&quot;The empress was of many languages.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To sensual vices she was so abandoned,</l>
    <l>That lustful she made licit in her law,</l>
    <l>To remove the blame to which she had been led.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>She is Semiramis, of whom we read</l>
    <l>That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;</l>
    <l>She held the land which now the Sultan rules.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The next is she who killed herself for love,</l>
    <l>And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;</l>
    <l>Then Cleopatra the voluptuous.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless</l>
    <l>Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,</l>
    <l>Who at the last hour combated with Love.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand</l>
    <l>Shades did he name and point out with his finger,</l>
    <l>Whom Love had separated from our life.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After that I had listened to my Teacher,</l>
    <l>Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,</l>
    <l>Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I began: &quot;O Poet, willingly</l>
    <l>Speak would I to those two, who go together,</l>
    <l>And seem upon the wind to be so light.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And, he to me: &quot;Thou'lt mark, when they shall be</l>
    <l>Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them</l>
    <l>By love which leadeth them, and they will come.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,</l>
    <l>My voice uplift I: &quot;O ye weary souls!</l>
    <l>Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,</l>
    <l>With open and steady wings to the sweet nest</l>
    <l>Fly through the air by their volition borne,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So came they from the band where Dido is,</l>
    <l>Approaching us athwart the air malign,</l>
    <l>So strong was the affectionate appeal.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O living creature gracious and benignant,</l>
    <l>Who visiting goest through the purple air</l>
    <l>Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If were the King of the Universe our friend,</l>
    <l>We would pray unto him to give thee peace,</l>
    <l>Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,</l>
    <l>That will we hear, and we will speak to you,</l>
    <l>While silent is the wind, as it is now.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,</l>
    <l>Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends</l>
    <l>To rest in peace with all his retinue.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,</l>
    <l>Seized this man for the person beautiful</l>
    <l>That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,</l>
    <l>Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,</l>
    <l>That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Love has conducted us unto one death;</l>
    <l>Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!&quot;</l>
    <l>These words were borne along from them to us.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,</l>
    <l>I bowed my face, and so long held it down</l>
    <l>Until the Poet said to me: &quot;What thinkest?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When I made answer, I began: &quot;Alas!</l>
    <l>How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,</l>
    <l>Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,</l>
    <l>And I began: &quot;Thine agonies, Francesca,</l>
    <l>Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,</l>
    <l>By what and in what manner Love conceded,</l>
    <l>That you should know your dubious desires?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And she to me: &quot;There is no greater sorrow</l>
    <l>Than to be mindful of the happy time</l>
    <l>In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But, if to recognise the earliest root</l>
    <l>Of love in us thou hast so great desire,</l>
    <l>I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One day we reading were for our delight</l>
    <l>Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.</l>
    <l>Alone we were and without any fear.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Full many a time our eyes together drew</l>
    <l>That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;</l>
    <l>But one point only was it that o'ercame us.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When as we read of the much-longed-for smile</l>
    <l>Being by such a noble lover kissed,</l>
    <l>This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.</l>
    <l>Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.</l>
    <l>That day no farther did we read therein.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And all the while one spirit uttered this,</l>
    <l>The other one did weep so, that, for pity,</l>
    <l>I swooned away as if I had been dying,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And fell, even as a dead body falls.</l>
