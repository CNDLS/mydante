  <p>
    <l>Broke the deep lethargy within my head</l>
    <l>A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,</l>
    <l>Like to a person who by force is wakened;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And round about I moved my rested eyes,</l>
    <l>Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,</l>
    <l>To recognise the place wherein I was.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>True is it, that upon the verge I found me</l>
    <l>Of the abysmal valley dolorous,</l>
    <l>That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,</l>
    <l>So that by fixing on its depths my sight</l>
    <l>Nothing whatever I discerned therein.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Let us descend now into the blind world,&quot;</l>
    <l>Began the Poet, pallid utterly;</l>
    <l>&quot;I will be first, and thou shalt second be.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I, who of his colour was aware,</l>
    <l>Said: &quot;How shall I come, if thou art afraid,</l>
    <l>Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;The anguish of the people</l>
    <l>Who are below here in my face depicts</l>
    <l>That pity which for terror thou hast taken.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Let us go on, for the long way impels us.&quot;</l>
    <l>Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter</l>
    <l>The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There, as it seemed to me from listening,</l>
    <l>Were lamentations none, but only sighs,</l>
    <l>That tremble made the everlasting air.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And this arose from sorrow without torment,</l>
    <l>Which the crowds had, that many were and great,</l>
    <l>Of infants and of women and of men.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To me the Master good: &quot;Thou dost not ask</l>
    <l>What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?</l>
    <l>Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That they sinned not; and if they merit had,</l>
    <l>'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism</l>
    <l>Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if they were before Christianity,</l>
    <l>In the right manner they adored not God;</l>
    <l>And among such as these am I myself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For such defects, and not for other guilt,</l>
    <l>Lost are we and are only so far punished,</l>
    <l>That without hope we live on in desire.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,</l>
    <l>Because some people of much worthiness</l>
    <l>I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,&quot;</l>
    <l>Began I, with desire of being certain</l>
    <l>Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Came any one by his own merit hence,</l>
    <l>Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?&quot;</l>
    <l>And he, who understood my covert speech,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Replied: &quot;I was a novice in this state,</l>
    <l>When I saw hither come a Mighty One,</l>
    <l>With sign of victory incoronate.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,</l>
    <l>And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,</l>
    <l>Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,</l>
    <l>Israel with his father and his children,</l>
    <l>And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And others many, and he made them blessed;</l>
    <l>And thou must know, that earlier than these</l>
    <l>Never were any human spirits saved.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We ceased not to advance because he spake,</l>
    <l>But still were passing onward through the forest,</l>
    <l>The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not very far as yet our way had gone</l>
    <l>This side the summit, when I saw a fire</l>
    <l>That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We were a little distant from it still,</l>
    <l>But not so far that I in part discerned not</l>
    <l>That honourable people held that place.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O thou who honourest every art and science,</l>
    <l>Who may these be, which such great honour have,</l>
    <l>That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;The honourable name,</l>
    <l>That sounds of them above there in thy life,</l>
    <l>Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In the mean time a voice was heard by me:</l>
    <l>&quot;All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;</l>
    <l>His shade returns again, that was departed.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After the voice had ceased and quiet was,</l>
    <l>Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;</l>
    <l>Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To say to me began my gracious Master:</l>
    <l>&quot;Him with that falchion in his hand behold,</l>
    <l>Who comes before the three, even as their lord.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;</l>
    <l>He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;</l>
    <l>The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because to each of these with me applies</l>
    <l>The name that solitary voice proclaimed,</l>
    <l>They do me honour, and in that do well.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus I beheld assemble the fair school</l>
    <l>Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,</l>
    <l>Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When they together had discoursed somewhat,</l>
    <l>They turned to me with signs of salutation,</l>
    <l>And on beholding this, my Master smiled;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And more of honour still, much more, they did me,</l>
    <l>In that they made me one of their own band;</l>
    <l>So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus we went on as far as to the light,</l>
    <l>Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,</l>
    <l>As was the saying of them where I was.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We came unto a noble castle's foot,</l>
    <l>Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,</l>
    <l>Defended round by a fair rivulet;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This we passed over even as firm ground;</l>
    <l>Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;</l>
    <l>We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>People were there with solemn eyes and slow,</l>
    <l>Of great authority in their countenance;</l>
    <l>They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side</l>
    <l>Into an opening luminous and lofty,</l>
    <l>So that they all of them were visible.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There opposite, upon the green enamel,</l>
    <l>Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,</l>
    <l>Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw Electra with companions many,</l>
    <l>'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,</l>
    <l>Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw Camilla and Penthesilea</l>
    <l>On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,</l>
    <l>Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,</l>
    <l>Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,</l>
    <l>And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When I had lifted up my brows a little,</l>
    <l>The Master I beheld of those who know,</l>
    <l>Sit with his philosophic family.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.</l>
    <l>There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,</l>
    <l>Who nearer him before the others stand;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Democritus, who puts the world on chance,</l>
    <l>Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,</l>
    <l>Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of qualities I saw the good collector,</l>
    <l>Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,</l>
    <l>Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,</l>
    <l>Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,</l>
    <l>Averroes, who the great Comment made.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I cannot all of them pourtray in full,</l>
    <l>Because so drives me onward the long theme,</l>
    <l>That many times the word comes short of fact.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The sixfold company in two divides;</l>
    <l>Another way my sapient Guide conducts me</l>
    <l>Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And to a place I come where nothing shines.</l>
