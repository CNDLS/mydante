  <p>
    <l>I say, continuing, that long before</l>
    <l>We to the foot of that high tower had come,</l>
    <l>Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,</l>
    <l>And from afar another answer them,</l>
    <l>So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And, to the sea of all discernment turned,</l>
    <l>I said: &quot;What sayeth this, and what respondeth</l>
    <l>That other fire? and who are they that made it?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;Across the turbid waves</l>
    <l>What is expected thou canst now discern,</l>
    <l>If reek of the morass conceal it not.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Cord never shot an arrow from itself</l>
    <l>That sped away athwart the air so swift,</l>
    <l>As I beheld a very little boat</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,</l>
    <l>Under the guidance of a single pilot,</l>
    <l>Who shouted, &quot;Now art thou arrived, fell soul?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain</l>
    <l>For this once,&quot; said my Lord; &quot;thou shalt not have us</l>
    <l>Longer than in the passing of the slough.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As he who listens to some great deceit</l>
    <l>That has been done to him, and then resents it,</l>
    <l>Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My Guide descended down into the boat,</l>
    <l>And then he made me enter after him,</l>
    <l>And only when I entered seemed it laden.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,</l>
    <l>The antique prow goes on its way, dividing</l>
    <l>More of the water than 'tis wont with others.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>While we were running through the dead canal,</l>
    <l>Uprose in front of me one full of mire,</l>
    <l>And said, &quot;Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I to him: &quot;Although I come, I stay not;</l>
    <l>But who art thou that hast become so squalid?&quot;</l>
    <l>&quot;Thou seest that I am one who weeps,&quot; he answered.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I to him: &quot;With weeping and with wailing,</l>
    <l>Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;</l>
    <l>For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;</l>
    <l>Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,</l>
    <l>Saying, &quot;Away there with the other dogs!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;</l>
    <l>He kissed my face, and said: &quot;Disdainful soul,</l>
    <l>Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That was an arrogant person in the world;</l>
    <l>Goodness is none, that decks his memory;</l>
    <l>So likewise here his shade is furious.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>How many are esteemed great kings up there,</l>
    <l>Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,</l>
    <l>Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I: &quot;My Master, much should I be pleased,</l>
    <l>If I could see him soused into this broth,</l>
    <l>Before we issue forth out of the lake.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;Ere unto thee the shore</l>
    <l>Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;</l>
    <l>Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A little after that, I saw such havoc</l>
    <l>Made of him by the people of the mire,</l>
    <l>That still I praise and thank my God for it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>They all were shouting, &quot;At Philippo Argenti!&quot;</l>
    <l>And that exasperate spirit Florentine</l>
    <l>Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We left him there, and more of him I tell not;</l>
    <l>But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,</l>
    <l>Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the good Master said: &quot;Even now, my Son,</l>
    <l>The city draweth near whose name is Dis,</l>
    <l>With the grave citizens, with the great throng.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I: &quot;Its mosques already, Master, clearly</l>
    <l>Within there in the valley I discern</l>
    <l>Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>They were.&quot;  And he to me: &quot;The fire eternal</l>
    <l>That kindles them within makes them look red,</l>
    <l>As thou beholdest in this nether Hell.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then we arrived within the moats profound,</l>
    <l>That circumvallate that disconsolate city;</l>
    <l>The walls appeared to me to be of iron.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not without making first a circuit wide,</l>
    <l>We came unto a place where loud the pilot</l>
    <l>Cried out to us, &quot;Debark, here is the entrance.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>More than a thousand at the gates I saw</l>
    <l>Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily</l>
    <l>Were saying, &quot;Who is this that without death</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?&quot;</l>
    <l>And my sagacious Master made a sign</l>
    <l>Of wishing secretly to speak with them.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A little then they quelled their great disdain,</l>
    <l>And said: &quot;Come thou alone, and he begone</l>
    <l>Who has so boldly entered these dominions.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Let him return alone by his mad road;</l>
    <l>Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,</l>
    <l>Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Think, Reader, if I was discomforted</l>
    <l>At utterance of the accursed words;</l>
    <l>For never to return here I believed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O my dear Guide, who more than seven times</l>
    <l>Hast rendered me security, and drawn me</l>
    <l>From imminent peril that before me stood,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Do not desert me,&quot; said I, &quot;thus undone;</l>
    <l>And if the going farther be denied us,</l>
    <l>Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,</l>
    <l>Said unto me: &quot;Fear not; because our passage</l>
    <l>None can take from us, it by Such is given.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But here await me, and thy weary spirit</l>
    <l>Comfort and nourish with a better hope;</l>
    <l>For in this nether world I will not leave thee.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So onward goes and there abandons me</l>
    <l>My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,</l>
    <l>For No and Yes within my head contend.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I could not hear what he proposed to them;</l>
    <l>But with them there he did not linger long,</l>
    <l>Ere each within in rivalry ran back.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>They closed the portals, those our adversaries,</l>
    <l>On my Lord's breast, who had remained without</l>
    <l>And turned to me with footsteps far between.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he</l>
    <l>Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,</l>
    <l>&quot;Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And unto me: &quot;Thou, because I am angry,</l>
    <l>Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,</l>
    <l>Whatever for defence within be planned.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;</l>
    <l>For once they used it at less secret gate,</l>
    <l>Which finds itself without a fastening still.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;</l>
    <l>And now this side of it descends the steep,</l>
    <l>Passing across the circles without escort,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One by whose means the city shall be opened.&quot;</l>
