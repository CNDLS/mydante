  <p>
    <l>Now onward goes, along a narrow path</l>
    <l>Between the torments and the city wall,</l>
    <l>My Master, and I follow at his back.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O power supreme, that through these impious circles</l>
    <l>Turnest me,&quot; I began, &quot;as pleases thee,</l>
    <l>Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The people who are lying in these tombs,</l>
    <l>Might they be seen? already are uplifted</l>
    <l>The covers all, and no one keepeth guard.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;They all will be closed up</l>
    <l>When from Jehoshaphat they shall return</l>
    <l>Here with the bodies they have left above.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Their cemetery have upon this side</l>
    <l>With Epicurus all his followers,</l>
    <l>Who with the body mortal make the soul;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But in the question thou dost put to me,</l>
    <l>Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,</l>
    <l>And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I: &quot;Good Leader, I but keep concealed</l>
    <l>From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,</l>
    <l>Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire</l>
    <l>Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,</l>
    <l>Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest</l>
    <l>A native of that noble fatherland,</l>
    <l>To which perhaps I too molestful was.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon a sudden issued forth this sound</l>
    <l>From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,</l>
    <l>Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And unto me he said: &quot;Turn thee; what dost thou?</l>
    <l>Behold there Farinata who has risen;</l>
    <l>From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I had already fixed mine eyes on his,</l>
    <l>And he uprose erect with breast and front</l>
    <l>E'en as if Hell he had in great despite.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader</l>
    <l>Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,</l>
    <l>Exclaiming, &quot;Let thy words explicit be.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb</l>
    <l>Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,</l>
    <l>Then asked of me, &quot;Who were thine ancestors?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I, who desirous of obeying was,</l>
    <l>Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;</l>
    <l>Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then said he: &quot;Fiercely adverse have they been</l>
    <l>To me, and to my fathers, and my party;</l>
    <l>So that two several times I scattered them.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;If they were banished, they returned on all sides,&quot;</l>
    <l>I answered him, &quot;the first time and the second;</l>
    <l>But yours have not acquired that art aright.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered</l>
    <l>Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;</l>
    <l>I think that he had risen on his knees.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Round me he gazed, as if solicitude</l>
    <l>He had to see if some one else were with me,</l>
    <l>But after his suspicion was all spent,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Weeping, he said to me: &quot;If through this blind</l>
    <l>Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,</l>
    <l>Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I to him: &quot;I come not of myself;</l>
    <l>He who is waiting yonder leads me here,</l>
    <l>Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>His language and the mode of punishment</l>
    <l>Already unto me had read his name;</l>
    <l>On that account my answer was so full.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Up starting suddenly, he cried out: &quot;How</l>
    <l>Saidst thou,--he had?  Is he not still alive?</l>
    <l>Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When he became aware of some delay,</l>
    <l>Which I before my answer made, supine</l>
    <l>He fell again, and forth appeared no more.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire</l>
    <l>I had remained, did not his aspect change,</l>
    <l>Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;And if,&quot; continuing his first discourse,</l>
    <l>&quot;They have that art,&quot; he said, &quot;not learned aright,</l>
    <l>That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But fifty times shall not rekindled be</l>
    <l>The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,</l>
    <l>Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,</l>
    <l>Say why that people is so pitiless</l>
    <l>Against my race in each one of its laws?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence I to him: &quot;The slaughter and great carnage</l>
    <l>Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause</l>
    <l>Such orisons in our temple to be made.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After his head he with a sigh had shaken,</l>
    <l>&quot;There I was not alone,&quot; he said, &quot;nor surely</l>
    <l>Without a cause had with the others moved.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But there I was alone, where every one</l>
    <l>Consented to the laying waste of Florence,</l>
    <l>He who defended her with open face.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,&quot;</l>
    <l>I him entreated, &quot;solve for me that knot,</l>
    <l>Which has entangled my conceptions here.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,</l>
    <l>Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,</l>
    <l>And in the present have another mode.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;We see, like those who have imperfect sight,</l>
    <l>The things,&quot; he said, &quot;that distant are from us;</l>
    <l>So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain</l>
    <l>Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,</l>
    <l>Not anything know we of your human state.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead</l>
    <l>Will be our knowledge from the moment when</l>
    <l>The portal of the future shall be closed.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,</l>
    <l>Said: &quot;Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,</l>
    <l>That still his son is with the living joined.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,</l>
    <l>Tell him I did it because I was thinking</l>
    <l>Already of the error you have solved me.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And now my Master was recalling me,</l>
    <l>Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit</l>
    <l>That he would tell me who was with him there.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He said: &quot;With more than a thousand here I lie;</l>
    <l>Within here is the second Frederick,</l>
    <l>And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereon he hid himself; and I towards</l>
    <l>The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting</l>
    <l>Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He moved along; and afterward thus going,</l>
    <l>He said to me, &quot;Why art thou so bewildered?&quot;</l>
    <l>And I in his inquiry satisfied him.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Let memory preserve what thou hast heard</l>
    <l>Against thyself,&quot; that Sage commanded me,</l>
    <l>&quot;And now attend here;&quot; and he raised his finger.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet</l>
    <l>Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,</l>
    <l>From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;</l>
    <l>We left the wall, and went towards the middle,</l>
    <l>Along a path that strikes into a valley,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.</l>
