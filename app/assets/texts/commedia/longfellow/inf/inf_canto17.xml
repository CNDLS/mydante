    <l>&quot;Behold the monster with the pointed tail,</l>
    <l>Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,</l>
    <l>Behold him who infecteth all the world.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus unto me my Guide began to say,</l>
    <l>And beckoned him that he should come to shore,</l>
    <l>Near to the confine of the trodden marble;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And that uncleanly image of deceit</l>
    <l>Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,</l>
    <l>But on the border did not drag its tail.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The face was as the face of a just man,</l>
    <l>Its semblance outwardly was so benign,</l>
    <l>And of a serpent all the trunk beside.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;</l>
    <l>The back, and breast, and both the sides it had</l>
    <l>Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With colours more, groundwork or broidery</l>
    <l>Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,</l>
    <l>Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,</l>
    <l>That part are in the water, part on land;</l>
    <l>And as among the guzzling Germans there,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The beaver plants himself to wage his war;</l>
    <l>So that vile monster lay upon the border,</l>
    <l>Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>His tail was wholly quivering in the void,</l>
    <l>Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,</l>
    <l>That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Guide said: &quot;Now perforce must turn aside</l>
    <l>Our way a little, even to that beast</l>
    <l>Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We therefore on the right side descended,</l>
    <l>And made ten steps upon the outer verge,</l>
    <l>Completely to avoid the sand and flame;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And after we are come to him, I see</l>
    <l>A little farther off upon the sand</l>
    <l>A people sitting near the hollow place.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then said to me the Master: &quot;So that full</l>
    <l>Experience of this round thou bear away,</l>
    <l>Now go and see what their condition is.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There let thy conversation be concise;</l>
    <l>Till thou returnest I will speak with him,</l>
    <l>That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus farther still upon the outermost</l>
    <l>Head of that seventh circle all alone</l>
    <l>I went, where sat the melancholy folk.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;</l>
    <l>This way, that way, they helped them with their hands</l>
    <l>Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,</l>
    <l>Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when</l>
    <l>By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces</l>
    <l>Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,</l>
    <l>Not one of them I knew; but I perceived</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,</l>
    <l>Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;</l>
    <l>And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as I gazing round me come among them,</l>
    <l>Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw</l>
    <l>That had the face and posture of a lion.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Proceeding then the current of my sight,</l>
    <l>Another of them saw I, red as blood,</l>
    <l>Display a goose more white than butter is.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And one, who with an azure sow and gravid</l>
    <l>Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,</l>
    <l>Said unto me: &quot;What dost thou in this moat?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,</l>
    <l>Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,</l>
    <l>Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A Paduan am I with these Florentines;</l>
    <l>Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,</l>
    <l>Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;'&quot;</l>
    <l>Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust</l>
    <l>His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And fearing lest my longer stay might vex</l>
    <l>Him who had warned me not to tarry long,</l>
    <l>Backward I turned me from those weary souls.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I found my Guide, who had already mounted</l>
    <l>Upon the back of that wild animal,</l>
    <l>And said to me: &quot;Now be both strong and bold.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now we descend by stairways such as these;</l>
    <l>Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,</l>
    <l>So that the tail may have no power to harm thee.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such as he is who has so near the ague</l>
    <l>Of quartan that his nails are blue already,</l>
    <l>And trembles all, but looking at the shade;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even such became I at those proffered words;</l>
    <l>But shame in me his menaces produced,</l>
    <l>Which maketh servant strong before good master.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;</l>
    <l>I wished to say, and yet the voice came not</l>
    <l>As I believed, &quot;Take heed that thou embrace me.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But he, who other times had rescued me</l>
    <l>In other peril, soon as I had mounted,</l>
    <l>Within his arms encircled and sustained me,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And said: &quot;Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;</l>
    <l>The circles large, and the descent be little;</l>
    <l>Think of the novel burden which thou hast.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,</l>
    <l>Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;</l>
    <l>And when he wholly felt himself afloat,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There where his breast had been he turned his tail,</l>
    <l>And that extended like an eel he moved,</l>
    <l>And with his paws drew to himself the air.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A greater fear I do not think there was</l>
    <l>What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,</l>
    <l>Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks</l>
    <l>Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,</l>
    <l>His father crying, &quot;An ill way thou takest!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Than was my own, when I perceived myself</l>
    <l>On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished</l>
    <l>The sight of everything but of the monster.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;</l>
    <l>Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only</l>
    <l>By wind upon my face and from below.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I heard already on the right the whirlpool</l>
    <l>Making a horrible crashing under us;</l>
    <l>Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;</l>
    <l>Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,</l>
    <l>Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw then, for before I had not seen it,</l>
    <l>The turning and descending, by great horrors</l>
    <l>That were approaching upon divers sides.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As falcon who has long been on the wing,</l>
    <l>Who, without seeing either lure or bird,</l>
    <l>Maketh the falconer say, &quot;Ah me, thou stoopest,&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,</l>
    <l>Thorough a hundred circles, and alights</l>
    <l>Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,</l>
    <l>Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,</l>
    <l>And being disencumbered of our persons,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He sped away as arrow from the string.</l>
