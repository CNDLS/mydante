    <l>I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,</l>
    <l>Begin the storming, and their muster make,</l>
    <l>And sometimes starting off for their escape;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,</l>
    <l>O Aretines, and foragers go forth,</l>
    <l>Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,</l>
    <l>With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,</l>
    <l>And with our own, and with outlandish things,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth</l>
    <l>Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,</l>
    <l>Nor ship by any sign of land or star.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We went upon our way with the ten demons;</l>
    <l>Ah, savage company! but in the church</l>
    <l>With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ever upon the pitch was my intent,</l>
    <l>To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,</l>
    <l>And of the people who therein were burned.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign</l>
    <l>To mariners by arching of the back,</l>
    <l>That they should counsel take to save their vessel,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,</l>
    <l>One of the sinners would display his back,</l>
    <l>And in less time conceal it than it lightens.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As on the brink of water in a ditch</l>
    <l>The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,</l>
    <l>So that they hide their feet and other bulk,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So upon every side the sinners stood;</l>
    <l>But ever as Barbariccia near them came,</l>
    <l>Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,</l>
    <l>One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass</l>
    <l>One frog remains, and down another dives;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,</l>
    <l>Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,</l>
    <l>And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I knew, before, the names of all of them,</l>
    <l>So had I noted them when they were chosen,</l>
    <l>And when they called each other, listened how.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O Rubicante, see that thou do lay</l>
    <l>Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,&quot;</l>
    <l>Cried all together the accursed ones.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I: &quot;My Master, see to it, if thou canst,</l>
    <l>That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,</l>
    <l>Thus come into his adversaries' hands.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Near to the side of him my Leader drew,</l>
    <l>Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:</l>
    <l>&quot;I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My mother placed me servant to a lord,</l>
    <l>For she had borne me to a ribald knave,</l>
    <l>Destroyer of himself and of his things.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;</l>
    <l>I set me there to practise barratry,</l>
    <l>For which I pay the reckoning in this heat.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,</l>
    <l>On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,</l>
    <l>Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Among malicious cats the mouse had come;</l>
    <l>But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,</l>
    <l>And said: &quot;Stand ye aside, while I enfork him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And to my Master he turned round his head;</l>
    <l>&quot;Ask him again,&quot; he said, &quot;if more thou wish</l>
    <l>To know from him, before some one destroy him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Guide: &quot;Now tell then of the other culprits;</l>
    <l>Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,</l>
    <l>Under the pitch?&quot;  And he: &quot;I separated</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;</l>
    <l>Would that I still were covered up with him,</l>
    <l>For I should fear not either claw nor hook!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And Libicocco: &quot;We have borne too much;&quot;</l>
    <l>And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,</l>
    <l>So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him</l>
    <l>Down at the legs; whence their Decurion</l>
    <l>Turned round and round about with evil look.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When they again somewhat were pacified,</l>
    <l>Of him, who still was looking at his wound,</l>
    <l>Demanded my Conductor without stay:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting</l>
    <l>Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?&quot;</l>
    <l>And he replied: &quot;It was the Friar Gomita,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,</l>
    <l>Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,</l>
    <l>And dealt so with them each exults thereat;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Money he took, and let them smoothly off,</l>
    <l>As he says; and in other offices</l>
    <l>A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche</l>
    <l>Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia</l>
    <l>To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;</l>
    <l>Still farther would I speak, but am afraid</l>
    <l>Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,</l>
    <l>Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,</l>
    <l>Said: &quot;Stand aside there, thou malicious bird.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;If you desire either to see or hear,&quot;</l>
    <l>The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,</l>
    <l>&quot;Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But let the Malebranche cease a little,</l>
    <l>So that these may not their revenges fear,</l>
    <l>And I, down sitting in this very place,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For one that I am will make seven come,</l>
    <l>When I shall whistle, as our custom is</l>
    <l>To do whenever one of us comes out.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,</l>
    <l>Shaking his head, and said: &quot;Just hear the trick</l>
    <l>Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,</l>
    <l>Responded: &quot;I by far too cunning am,</l>
    <l>When I procure for mine a greater sadness.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Alichin held not in, but running counter</l>
    <l>Unto the rest, said to him: &quot;If thou dive,</l>
    <l>I will not follow thee upon the gallop,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But I will beat my wings above the pitch;</l>
    <l>The height be left, and be the bank a shield</l>
    <l>To see if thou alone dost countervail us.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!</l>
    <l>Each to the other side his eyes averted;</l>
    <l>He first, who most reluctant was to do it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Navarrese selected well his time;</l>
    <l>Planted his feet on land, and in a moment</l>
    <l>Leaped, and released himself from their design.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,</l>
    <l>But he most who was cause of the defeat;</l>
    <l>Therefore he moved, and cried: &quot;Thou art o'ertakern.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But little it availed, for wings could not</l>
    <l>Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,</l>
    <l>And, flying, upward he his breast directed;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden</l>
    <l>Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,</l>
    <l>And upward he returneth cross and weary.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina</l>
    <l>Flying behind him followed close, desirous</l>
    <l>The other should escape, to have a quarrel.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And when the barrator had disappeared,</l>
    <l>He turned his talons upon his companion,</l>
    <l>And grappled with him right above the moat.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk</l>
    <l>To clapperclaw him well; and both of them</l>
    <l>Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A sudden intercessor was the heat;</l>
    <l>But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught,</l>
    <l>To such degree they had their wings belimed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia</l>
    <l>Made four of them fly to the other side</l>
    <l>With all their gaffs, and very speedily</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This side and that they to their posts descended;</l>
    <l>They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,</l>
    <l>Who were already baked within the crust,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And in this manner busied did we leave them.</l>
