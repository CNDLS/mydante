  <p>
    <l>'Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,</l>
    <l>For Semele, against the Theban blood,</l>
    <l>As she already more than once had shown,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So reft of reason Athamas became,</l>
    <l>That, seeing his own wife with children twain</l>
    <l>Walking encumbered upon either hand,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He cried: &quot;Spread out the nets, that I may take</l>
    <l>The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;&quot;</l>
    <l>And then extended his unpitying claws,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,</l>
    <l>And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;</l>
    <l>And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;--</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And at the time when fortune downward hurled</l>
    <l>The Trojan's arrogance, that all things dared,</l>
    <l>So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,</l>
    <l>When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,</l>
    <l>And of her Polydorus on the shore</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,</l>
    <l>Out of her senses like a dog she barked,</l>
    <l>So much the anguish had her mind distorted;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan</l>
    <l>Were ever seen in any one so cruel</l>
    <l>In goading beasts, and much more human members,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,</l>
    <l>Who, biting, in the manner ran along</l>
    <l>That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One to Capocchio came, and by the nape</l>
    <l>Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging</l>
    <l>It made his belly grate the solid bottom.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,</l>
    <l>Said to me: &quot;That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,</l>
    <l>And raving goes thus harrying other people.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O,&quot; said I to him, &quot;so may not the other</l>
    <l>Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee</l>
    <l>To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;That is the ancient ghost</l>
    <l>Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became</l>
    <l>Beyond all rightful love her father's lover.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>She came to sin with him after this manner,</l>
    <l>By counterfeiting of another's form;</l>
    <l>As he who goeth yonder undertook,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That he might gain the lady of the herd,</l>
    <l>To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,</l>
    <l>Making a will and giving it due form.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And after the two maniacs had passed</l>
    <l>On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back</l>
    <l>To look upon the other evil-born.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw one made in fashion of a lute,</l>
    <l>If he had only had the groin cut off</l>
    <l>Just at the point at which a man is forked.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions</l>
    <l>The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,</l>
    <l>That the face corresponds not to the belly,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Compelled him so to hold his lips apart</l>
    <l>As does the hectic, who because of thirst</l>
    <l>One tow'rds the chin, the other upward turns.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O ye, who without any torment are,</l>
    <l>And why I know not, in the world of woe,&quot;</l>
    <l>He said to us, &quot;behold, and be attentive</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Unto the misery of Master Adam;</l>
    <l>I had while living much of what I wished,</l>
    <l>And now, alas! a drop of water crave.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The rivulets, that from the verdant hills</l>
    <l>Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,</l>
    <l>Making their channels to be cold and moist,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ever before me stand, and not in vain;</l>
    <l>For far more doth their image dry me up</l>
    <l>Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The rigid justice that chastises me</l>
    <l>Draweth occasion from the place in which</l>
    <l>I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There is Romena, where I counterfeited</l>
    <l>The currency imprinted with the Baptist,</l>
    <l>For which I left my body burned above.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But if I here could see the tristful soul</l>
    <l>Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,</l>
    <l>For Branda's fount I would not give the sight.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One is within already, if the raving</l>
    <l>Shades that are going round about speak truth;</l>
    <l>But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If I were only still so light, that in</l>
    <l>A hundred years I could advance one inch,</l>
    <l>I had already started on the way,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Seeking him out among this squalid folk,</l>
    <l>Although the circuit be eleven miles,</l>
    <l>And be not less than half a mile across.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For them am I in such a family;</l>
    <l>They did induce me into coining florins,</l>
    <l>Which had three carats of impurity.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I to him: &quot;Who are the two poor wretches</l>
    <l>That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,</l>
    <l>Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;I found them here,&quot; replied he, &quot;when I rained</l>
    <l>Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,</l>
    <l>Nor do I think they will for evermore.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One the false woman is who accused Joseph,</l>
    <l>The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;</l>
    <l>From acute fever they send forth such reek.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And one of them, who felt himself annoyed</l>
    <l>At being, peradventure, named so darkly,</l>
    <l>Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;</l>
    <l>And Master Adam smote him in the face,</l>
    <l>With arm that did not seem to be less hard,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Saying to him: &quot;Although be taken from me</l>
    <l>All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,</l>
    <l>I have an arm unfettered for such need.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whereat he answer made: &quot;When thou didst go</l>
    <l>Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:</l>
    <l>But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The dropsical: &quot;Thou sayest true in that;</l>
    <l>But thou wast not so true a witness there,</l>
    <l>Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,&quot;</l>
    <l>Said Sinon; &quot;and for one fault I am here,</l>
    <l>And thou for more than any other demon.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Remember, perjurer, about the horse,&quot;</l>
    <l>He made reply who had the swollen belly,</l>
    <l>&quot;And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks</l>
    <l>Thy tongue,&quot; the Greek said, &quot;and the putrid water</l>
    <l>That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then the false-coiner: &quot;So is gaping wide</l>
    <l>Thy mouth for speaking evil, as 'tis wont;</l>
    <l>Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,</l>
    <l>And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus</l>
    <l>Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In listening to them was I wholly fixed,</l>
    <l>When said the Master to me: &quot;Now just look,</l>
    <l>For little wants it that I quarrel with thee.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When him I heard in anger speak to me,</l>
    <l>I turned me round towards him with such shame</l>
    <l>That still it eddies through my memory.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as he is who dreams of his own harm,</l>
    <l>Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,</l>
    <l>So that he craves what is, as if it were not;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such I became, not having power to speak,</l>
    <l>For to excuse myself I wished, and still</l>
    <l>Excused myself, and did not think I did it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,&quot;</l>
    <l>The Master said, &quot;than this of thine has been;</l>
    <l>Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And make account that I am aye beside thee,</l>
    <l>If e'er it come to pass that fortune bring thee</l>
    <l>Where there are people in a like dispute;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For a base wish it is to wish to hear it.&quot;</l>
