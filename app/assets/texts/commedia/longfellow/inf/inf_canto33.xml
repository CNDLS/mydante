  <p>
    <l>His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,</l>
    <l>That sinner, wiping it upon the hair</l>
    <l>Of the same head that he behind had wasted.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then he began: &quot;Thou wilt that I renew</l>
    <l>The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already</l>
    <l>To think of only, ere I speak of it;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But if my words be seed that may bear fruit</l>
    <l>Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,</l>
    <l>Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I know not who thou art, nor by what mode</l>
    <l>Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine</l>
    <l>Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,</l>
    <l>And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;</l>
    <l>Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,</l>
    <l>Trusting in him I was made prisoner,</l>
    <l>And after put to death, I need not say;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But ne'ertheless what thou canst not have heard,</l>
    <l>That is to say, how cruel was my death,</l>
    <l>Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A narrow perforation in the mew,</l>
    <l>Which bears because of me the title of Famine,</l>
    <l>And in which others still must be locked up,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Had shown me through its opening many moons</l>
    <l>Already, when I dreamed the evil dream</l>
    <l>Which of the future rent for me the veil.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This one appeared to me as lord and master,</l>
    <l>Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain</l>
    <l>For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,</l>
    <l>Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi</l>
    <l>He had sent out before him to the front.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After brief course seemed unto me forespent</l>
    <l>The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes</l>
    <l>It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When I before the morrow was awake,</l>
    <l>Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons</l>
    <l>Who with me were, and asking after bread.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,</l>
    <l>Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,</l>
    <l>And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh</l>
    <l>At which our food used to be brought to us,</l>
    <l>And through his dream was each one apprehensive;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I heard locking up the under door</l>
    <l>Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word</l>
    <l>I gazed into the faces of my sons.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I wept not, I within so turned to stone;</l>
    <l>They wept; and darling little Anselm mine</l>
    <l>Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made</l>
    <l>All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,</l>
    <l>Until another sun rose on the world.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As now a little glimmer made its way</l>
    <l>Into the dolorous prison, and I saw</l>
    <l>Upon four faces my own very aspect,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Both of my hands in agony I bit;</l>
    <l>And, thinking that I did it from desire</l>
    <l>Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us</l>
    <l>If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us</l>
    <l>With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.</l>
    <l>That day we all were silent, and the next.</l>
    <l>Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo</l>
    <l>Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,</l>
    <l>Saying, 'My father, why dost thou not help me?'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And there he died; and, as thou seest me,</l>
    <l>I saw the three fall, one by one, between</l>
    <l>The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Already blind, to groping over each,</l>
    <l>And three days called them after they were dead;</l>
    <l>Then hunger did what sorrow could not do.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,</l>
    <l>The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,</l>
    <l>Which, as a dog's, upon the bone were strong.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people</l>
    <l>Of the fair land there where the 'Si' doth sound,</l>
    <l>Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,</l>
    <l>And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno</l>
    <l>That every person in thee it may drown!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For if Count Ugolino had the fame</l>
    <l>Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,</l>
    <l>Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!</l>
    <l>Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,</l>
    <l>And the other two my song doth name above!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We passed still farther onward, where the ice</l>
    <l>Another people ruggedly enswathes,</l>
    <l>Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Weeping itself there does not let them weep,</l>
    <l>And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes</l>
    <l>Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because the earliest tears a cluster form,</l>
    <l>And, in the manner of a crystal visor,</l>
    <l>Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,</l>
    <l>Because of cold all sensibility</l>
    <l>Its station had abandoned in my face,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;</l>
    <l>Whence I: &quot;My Master, who sets this in motion?</l>
    <l>Is not below here every vapour quenched?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence he to me: &quot;Full soon shalt thou be where</l>
    <l>Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,</l>
    <l>Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And one of the wretches of the frozen crust</l>
    <l>Cried out to us: &quot;O souls so merciless</l>
    <l>That the last post is given unto you,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I</l>
    <l>May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart</l>
    <l>A little, e'er the weeping recongeal.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence I to him: &quot;If thou wouldst have me help thee</l>
    <l>Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,</l>
    <l>May I go to the bottom of the ice.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then he replied: &quot;I am Friar Alberigo;</l>
    <l>He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,</l>
    <l>Who here a date am getting for my fig.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O,&quot; said I to him, &quot;now art thou, too, dead?&quot;</l>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;How may my body fare</l>
    <l>Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,</l>
    <l>That oftentimes the soul descendeth here</l>
    <l>Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And, that thou mayest more willingly remove</l>
    <l>From off my countenance these glassy tears,</l>
    <l>Know that as soon as any soul betrays</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As I have done, his body by a demon</l>
    <l>Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,</l>
    <l>Until his time has wholly been revolved.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Itself down rushes into such a cistern;</l>
    <l>And still perchance above appears the body</l>
    <l>Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;</l>
    <l>It is Ser Branca d' Oria, and many years</l>
    <l>Have passed away since he was thus locked up.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;I think,&quot; said I to him, &quot;thou dost deceive me;</l>
    <l>For Branca d' Oria is not dead as yet,</l>
    <l>And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;In moat above,&quot; said he, &quot;of Malebranche,</l>
    <l>There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,</l>
    <l>As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When this one left a devil in his stead</l>
    <l>In his own body and one near of kin,</l>
    <l>Who made together with him the betrayal.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,</l>
    <l>Open mine eyes;&quot;--and open them I did not,</l>
    <l>And to be rude to him was courtesy.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance</l>
    <l>With every virtue, full of every vice</l>
    <l>Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For with the vilest spirit of Romagna</l>
    <l>I found of you one such, who for his deeds</l>
    <l>In soul already in Cocytus bathes,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And still above in body seems alive!</l>
