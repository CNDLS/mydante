  <p>
    <l>Looking into his Son with all the Love</l>
    <l>Which each of them eternally breathes forth,</l>
    <l>The Primal and unutterable Power</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whate'er before the mind or eye revolves</l>
    <l>With so much order made, there can be none</l>
    <l>Who this beholds without enjoying Him.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Lift up then, Reader, to the lofty wheels</l>
    <l>With me thy vision straight unto that part</l>
    <l>Where the one motion on the other strikes,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And there begin to contemplate with joy</l>
    <l>That Master's art, who in himself so loves it</l>
    <l>That never doth his eye depart therefrom.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Behold how from that point goes branching off</l>
    <l>The oblique circle, which conveys the planets,</l>
    <l>To satisfy the world that calls upon them;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if their pathway were not thus inflected,</l>
    <l>Much virtue in the heavens would be in vain,</l>
    <l>And almost every power below here dead.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If from the straight line distant more or less</l>
    <l>Were the departure, much would wanting be</l>
    <l>Above and underneath of mundane order.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Remain now, Reader, still upon thy bench,</l>
    <l>In thought pursuing that which is foretasted,</l>
    <l>If thou wouldst jocund be instead of weary.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I've set before thee; henceforth feed thyself,</l>
    <l>For to itself diverteth all my care</l>
    <l>That theme whereof I have been made the scribe.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The greatest of the ministers of nature,</l>
    <l>Who with the power of heaven the world imprints</l>
    <l>And measures with his light the time for us,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With that part which above is called to mind</l>
    <l>Conjoined, along the spirals was revolving,</l>
    <l>Where each time earlier he presents himself;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I was with him; but of the ascending</l>
    <l>I was not conscious, saving as a man</l>
    <l>Of a first thought is conscious ere it come;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And Beatrice, she who is seen to pass</l>
    <l>From good to better, and so suddenly</l>
    <l>That not by time her action is expressed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>How lucent in herself must she have been!</l>
    <l>And what was in the sun, wherein I entered,</l>
    <l>Apparent not by colour but by light,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I, though I call on genius, art, and practice,</l>
    <l>Cannot so tell that it could be imagined;</l>
    <l>Believe one can, and let him long to see it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if our fantasies too lowly are</l>
    <l>For altitude so great, it is no marvel,</l>
    <l>Since o'er the sun was never eye could go.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such in this place was the fourth family</l>
    <l>Of the high Father, who forever sates it,</l>
    <l>Showing how he breathes forth and how begets.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And Beatrice began: &quot;Give thanks, give thanks</l>
    <l>Unto the Sun of Angels, who to this</l>
    <l>Sensible one has raised thee by his grace!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Never was heart of mortal so disposed</l>
    <l>To worship, nor to give itself to God</l>
    <l>With all its gratitude was it so ready,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As at those words did I myself become;</l>
    <l>And all my love was so absorbed in Him,</l>
    <l>That in oblivion Beatrice was eclipsed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor this displeased her; but she smiled at it</l>
    <l>So that the splendour of her laughing eyes</l>
    <l>My single mind on many things divided.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Lights many saw I, vivid and triumphant,</l>
    <l>Make us a centre and themselves a circle,</l>
    <l>More sweet in voice than luminous in aspect.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus girt about the daughter of Latona</l>
    <l>We sometimes see, when pregnant is the air,</l>
    <l>So that it holds the thread which makes her zone.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within the court of Heaven, whence I return,</l>
    <l>Are many jewels found, so fair and precious</l>
    <l>They cannot be transported from the realm;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And of them was the singing of those lights.</l>
    <l>Who takes not wings that he may fly up thither,</l>
    <l>The tidings thence may from the dumb await!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As soon as singing thus those burning suns</l>
    <l>Had round about us whirled themselves three times,</l>
    <l>Like unto stars neighbouring the steadfast poles,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ladies they seemed, not from the dance released,</l>
    <l>But who stop short, in silence listening</l>
    <l>Till they have gathered the new melody.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And within one I heard beginning: &quot;When</l>
    <l>The radiance of grace, by which is kindled</l>
    <l>True love, and which thereafter grows by loving,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within thee multiplied is so resplendent</l>
    <l>That it conducts thee upward by that stair,</l>
    <l>Where without reascending none descends,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Who should deny the wine out of his vial</l>
    <l>Unto thy thirst, in liberty were not</l>
    <l>Except as water which descends not seaward.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Fain wouldst thou know with what plants is enflowered</l>
    <l>This garland that encircles with delight</l>
    <l>The Lady fair who makes thee strong for heaven.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of the lambs was I of the holy flock</l>
    <l>Which Dominic conducteth by a road</l>
    <l>Where well one fattens if he strayeth not.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He who is nearest to me on the right</l>
    <l>My brother and master was; and he Albertus</l>
    <l>Is of Cologne, I Thomas of Aquinum.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If thou of all the others wouldst be certain,</l>
    <l>Follow behind my speaking with thy sight</l>
    <l>Upward along the blessed garland turning.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That next effulgence issues from the smile</l>
    <l>Of Gratian, who assisted both the courts</l>
    <l>In such wise that it pleased in Paradise.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The other which near by adorns our choir</l>
    <l>That Peter was who, e'en as the poor widow,</l>
    <l>Offered his treasure unto Holy Church.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The fifth light, that among us is the fairest,</l>
    <l>Breathes forth from such a love, that all the world</l>
    <l>Below is greedy to learn tidings of it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within it is the lofty mind, where knowledge</l>
    <l>So deep was put, that, if the true be true,</l>
    <l>To see so much there never rose a second.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou seest next the lustre of that taper,</l>
    <l>Which in the flesh below looked most within</l>
    <l>The angelic nature and its ministry.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within that other little light is smiling</l>
    <l>The advocate of the Christian centuries,</l>
    <l>Out of whose rhetoric Augustine was furnished.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now if thou trainest thy mind's eye along</l>
    <l>From light to light pursuant of my praise,</l>
    <l>With thirst already of the eighth thou waitest.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>By seeing every good therein exults</l>
    <l>The sainted soul, which the fallacious world</l>
    <l>Makes manifest to him who listeneth well;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The body whence 'twas hunted forth is lying</l>
    <l>Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom</l>
    <l>And banishment it came unto this peace.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>See farther onward flame the burning breath</l>
    <l>Of Isidore, of Beda, and of Richard</l>
    <l>Who was in contemplation more than man.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This, whence to me returneth thy regard,</l>
    <l>The light is of a spirit unto whom</l>
    <l>In his grave meditations death seemed slow.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It is the light eternal of Sigier,</l>
    <l>Who, reading lectures in the Street of Straw,</l>
    <l>Did syllogize invidious verities.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then, as a horologe that calleth us</l>
    <l>What time the Bride of God is rising up</l>
    <l>With matins to her Spouse that he may love her,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Wherein one part the other draws and urges,</l>
    <l>Ting! ting! resounding with so sweet a note,</l>
    <l>That swells with love the spirit well disposed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus I beheld the glorious wheel move round,</l>
    <l>And render voice to voice, in modulation</l>
    <l>And sweetness that can not be comprehended,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Excepting there where joy is made eternal.</l>
