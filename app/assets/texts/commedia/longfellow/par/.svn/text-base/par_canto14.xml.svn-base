  <p>
    <l>From centre unto rim, from rim to centre,</l>
    <l>In a round vase the water moves itself,</l>
    <l>As from without 'tis struck or from within.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Into my mind upon a sudden dropped</l>
    <l>What I am saying, at the moment when</l>
    <l>Silent became the glorious life of Thomas,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because of the resemblance that was born</l>
    <l>Of his discourse and that of Beatrice,</l>
    <l>Whom, after him, it pleased thus to begin:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;This man has need (and does not tell you so,</l>
    <l>Nor with the voice, nor even in his thought)</l>
    <l>Of going to the root of one truth more.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Declare unto him if the light wherewith</l>
    <l>Blossoms your substance shall remain with you</l>
    <l>Eternally the same that it is now;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if it do remain, say in what manner,</l>
    <l>After ye are again made visible,</l>
    <l>It can be that it injure not your sight.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As by a greater gladness urged and drawn</l>
    <l>They who are dancing in a ring sometimes</l>
    <l>Uplift their voices and their motions quicken;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So, at that orison devout and prompt,</l>
    <l>The holy circles a new joy displayed</l>
    <l>In their revolving and their wondrous song.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whoso lamenteth him that here we die</l>
    <l>That we may live above, has never there</l>
    <l>Seen the refreshment of the eternal rain.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The One and Two and Three who ever liveth,</l>
    <l>And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One,</l>
    <l>Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Three several times was chanted by each one</l>
    <l>Among those spirits, with such melody</l>
    <l>That for all merit it were just reward;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And, in the lustre most divine of all</l>
    <l>The lesser ring, I heard a modest voice,</l>
    <l>Such as perhaps the Angel's was to Mary,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Answer: &quot;As long as the festivity</l>
    <l>Of Paradise shall be, so long our love</l>
    <l>Shall radiate round about us such a vesture.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Its brightness is proportioned to the ardour,</l>
    <l>The ardour to the vision; and the vision</l>
    <l>Equals what grace it has above its worth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When, glorious and sanctified, our flesh</l>
    <l>Is reassumed, then shall our persons be</l>
    <l>More pleasing by their being all complete;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For will increase whate'er bestows on us</l>
    <l>Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme,</l>
    <l>Light which enables us to look on Him;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore the vision must perforce increase,</l>
    <l>Increase the ardour which from that is kindled,</l>
    <l>Increase the radiance which from this proceeds.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But even as a coal that sends forth flame,</l>
    <l>And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it</l>
    <l>So that its own appearance it maintains,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus the effulgence that surrounds us now</l>
    <l>Shall be o'erpowered in aspect by the flesh,</l>
    <l>Which still to-day the earth doth cover up;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor can so great a splendour weary us,</l>
    <l>For strong will be the organs of the body</l>
    <l>To everything which hath the power to please us.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So sudden and alert appeared to me</l>
    <l>Both one and the other choir to say Amen,</l>
    <l>That well they showed desire for their dead bodies;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor sole for them perhaps, but for the mothers,</l>
    <l>The fathers, and the rest who had been dear</l>
    <l>Or ever they became eternal flames.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And lo! all round about of equal brightness</l>
    <l>Arose a lustre over what was there,</l>
    <l>Like an horizon that is clearing up.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as at rise of early eve begin</l>
    <l>Along the welkin new appearances,</l>
    <l>So that the sight seems real and unreal,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It seemed to me that new subsistences</l>
    <l>Began there to be seen, and make a circle</l>
    <l>Outside the other two circumferences.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O very sparkling of the Holy Spirit,</l>
    <l>How sudden and incandescent it became</l>
    <l>Unto mine eyes, that vanquished bore it not!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But Beatrice so beautiful and smiling</l>
    <l>Appeared to me, that with the other sights</l>
    <l>That followed not my memory I must leave her.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed</l>
    <l>The power, and I beheld myself translated</l>
    <l>To higher salvation with my Lady only.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Well was I ware that I was more uplifted</l>
    <l>By the enkindled smiling of the star,</l>
    <l>That seemed to me more ruddy than its wont.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With all my heart, and in that dialect</l>
    <l>Which is the same in all, such holocaust</l>
    <l>To God I made as the new grace beseemed;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And not yet from my bosom was exhausted</l>
    <l>The ardour of sacrifice, before I knew</l>
    <l>This offering was accepted and auspicious;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For with so great a lustre and so red</l>
    <l>Splendours appeared to me in twofold rays,</l>
    <l>I said: &quot;O Helios who dost so adorn them!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as distinct with less and greater lights</l>
    <l>Glimmers between the two poles of the world</l>
    <l>The Galaxy that maketh wise men doubt,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus constellated in the depths of Mars,</l>
    <l>Those rays described the venerable sign</l>
    <l>That quadrants joining in a circle make.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Here doth my memory overcome my genius;</l>
    <l>For on that cross as levin gleamed forth Christ,</l>
    <l>So that I cannot find ensample worthy;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But he who takes his cross and follows Christ</l>
    <l>Again will pardon me what I omit,</l>
    <l>Seeing in that aurora lighten Christ.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From horn to horn, and 'twixt the top and base,</l>
    <l>Lights were in motion, brightly scintillating</l>
    <l>As they together met and passed each other;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus level and aslant and swift and slow</l>
    <l>We here behold, renewing still the sight,</l>
    <l>The particles of bodies long and short,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Across the sunbeam move, wherewith is listed</l>
    <l>Sometimes the shade, which for their own defence</l>
    <l>People with cunning and with art contrive.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as a lute and harp, accordant strung</l>
    <l>With many strings, a dulcet tinkling make</l>
    <l>To him by whom the notes are not distinguished,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So from the lights that there to me appeared</l>
    <l>Upgathered through the cross a melody,</l>
    <l>Which rapt me, not distinguishing the hymn.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Well was I ware it was of lofty laud,</l>
    <l>Because there came to me, &quot;Arise and conquer!&quot;</l>
    <l>As unto him who hears and comprehends not.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So much enamoured I became therewith,</l>
    <l>That until then there was not anything</l>
    <l>That e'er had fettered me with such sweet bonds.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold,</l>
    <l>Postponing the delight of those fair eyes,</l>
    <l>Into which gazing my desire has rest;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But who bethinks him that the living seals</l>
    <l>Of every beauty grow in power ascending,</l>
    <l>And that I there had not turned round to those,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Can me excuse, if I myself accuse</l>
    <l>To excuse myself, and see that I speak truly:</l>
    <l>For here the holy joy is not disclosed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because ascending it becomes more pure.</l>
