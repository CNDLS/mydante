  <p>
    <l>O thou our poor nobility of blood,</l>
    <l>If thou dost make the people glory in thee</l>
    <l>Down here where our affection languishes,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A marvellous thing it ne'er will be to me;</l>
    <l>For there where appetite is not perverted,</l>
    <l>I say in Heaven, of thee I made a boast!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Truly thou art a cloak that quickly shortens,</l>
    <l>So that unless we piece thee day by day</l>
    <l>Time goeth round about thee with his shears!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With 'You,' which Rome was first to tolerate,</l>
    <l>(Wherein her family less perseveres,)</l>
    <l>Yet once again my words beginning made;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence Beatrice, who stood somewhat apart,</l>
    <l>Smiling, appeared like unto her who coughed</l>
    <l>At the first failing writ of Guenever.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I began: &quot;You are my ancestor,</l>
    <l>You give to me all hardihood to speak,</l>
    <l>You lift me so that I am more than I.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So many rivulets with gladness fill</l>
    <l>My mind, that of itself it makes a joy</l>
    <l>Because it can endure this and not burst.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then tell me, my beloved root ancestral,</l>
    <l>Who were your ancestors, and what the years</l>
    <l>That in your boyhood chronicled themselves?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Tell me about the sheepfold of Saint John,</l>
    <l>How large it was, and who the people were</l>
    <l>Within it worthy of the highest seats.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As at the blowing of the winds a coal</l>
    <l>Quickens to flame, so I beheld that light</l>
    <l>Become resplendent at my blandishments.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as unto mine eyes it grew more fair,</l>
    <l>With voice more sweet and tender, but not in</l>
    <l>This modern dialect, it said to me:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;From uttering of the 'Ave,' till the birth</l>
    <l>In which my mother, who is now a saint,</l>
    <l>Of me was lightened who had been her burden,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Unto its Lion had this fire returned</l>
    <l>Five hundred fifty times and thirty more,</l>
    <l>To reinflame itself beneath his paw.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My ancestors and I our birthplace had</l>
    <l>Where first is found the last ward of the city</l>
    <l>By him who runneth in your annual game.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Suffice it of my elders to hear this;</l>
    <l>But who they were, and whence they thither came,</l>
    <l>Silence is more considerate than speech.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>All those who at that time were there between</l>
    <l>Mars and the Baptist, fit for bearing arms,</l>
    <l>Were a fifth part of those who now are living;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But the community, that now is mixed</l>
    <l>With Campi and Certaldo and Figghine,</l>
    <l>Pure in the lowest artisan was seen.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O how much better 'twere to have as neighbours</l>
    <l>The folk of whom I speak, and at Galluzzo</l>
    <l>And at Trespiano have your boundary,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Than have them in the town, and bear the stench</l>
    <l>Of Aguglione's churl, and him of Signa</l>
    <l>Who has sharp eyes for trickery already.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Had not the folk, which most of all the world</l>
    <l>Degenerates, been a step-dame unto Caesar,</l>
    <l>But as a mother to her son benignant,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Some who turn Florentines, and trade and discount,</l>
    <l>Would have gone back again to Simifonte</l>
    <l>There where their grandsires went about as beggars.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>At Montemurlo still would be the Counts,</l>
    <l>The Cerchi in the parish of Acone,</l>
    <l>Perhaps in Valdigrieve the Buondelmonti.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ever the intermingling of the people</l>
    <l>Has been the source of malady in cities,</l>
    <l>As in the body food it surfeits on;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And a blind bull more headlong plunges down</l>
    <l>Than a blind lamb; and very often cuts</l>
    <l>Better and more a single sword than five.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If Luni thou regard, and Urbisaglia,</l>
    <l>How they have passed away, and how are passing</l>
    <l>Chiusi and Sinigaglia after them,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To hear how races waste themselves away,</l>
    <l>Will seem to thee no novel thing nor hard,</l>
    <l>Seeing that even cities have an end.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>All things of yours have their mortality,</l>
    <l>Even as yourselves; but it is hidden in some</l>
    <l>That a long while endure, and lives are short;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as the turning of the lunar heaven</l>
    <l>Covers and bares the shores without a pause,</l>
    <l>In the like manner fortune does with Florence.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore should not appear a marvellous thing</l>
    <l>What I shall say of the great Florentines</l>
    <l>Of whom the fame is hidden in the Past.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw the Ughi, saw the Catellini,</l>
    <l>Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, and Alberichi,</l>
    <l>Even in their fall illustrious citizens;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And saw, as mighty as they ancient were,</l>
    <l>With him of La Sannella him of Arca,</l>
    <l>And Soldanier, Ardinghi, and Bostichi.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Near to the gate that is at present laden</l>
    <l>With a new felony of so much weight</l>
    <l>That soon it shall be jetsam from the bark,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Ravignani were, from whom descended</l>
    <l>The County Guido, and whoe'er the name</l>
    <l>Of the great Bellincione since hath taken.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He of La Pressa knew the art of ruling</l>
    <l>Already, and already Galigajo</l>
    <l>Had hilt and pommel gilded in his house.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Mighty already was the Column Vair,</l>
    <l>Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifant, and Barucci,</l>
    <l>And Galli, and they who for the bushel blush.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The stock from which were the Calfucci born</l>
    <l>Was great already, and already chosen</l>
    <l>To curule chairs the Sizii and Arrigucci.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O how beheld I those who are undone</l>
    <l>By their own pride! and how the Balls of Gold</l>
    <l>Florence enflowered in all their mighty deeds!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So likewise did the ancestors of those</l>
    <l>Who evermore, when vacant is your church,</l>
    <l>Fatten by staying in consistory.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The insolent race, that like a dragon follows</l>
    <l>Whoever flees, and unto him that shows</l>
    <l>His teeth or purse is gentle as a lamb,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Already rising was, but from low people;</l>
    <l>So that it pleased not Ubertin Donato</l>
    <l>That his wife's father should make him their kin.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Already had Caponsacco to the Market</l>
    <l>From Fesole descended, and already</l>
    <l>Giuda and Infangato were good burghers.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I'll tell a thing incredible, but true;</l>
    <l>One entered the small circuit by a gate</l>
    <l>Which from the Della Pera took its name!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Each one that bears the beautiful escutcheon</l>
    <l>Of the great baron whose renown and name</l>
    <l>The festival of Thomas keepeth fresh,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Knighthood and privilege from him received;</l>
    <l>Though with the populace unites himself</l>
    <l>To-day the man who binds it with a border.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Already were Gualterotti and Importuni;</l>
    <l>And still more quiet would the Borgo be</l>
    <l>If with new neighbours it remained unfed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The house from which is born your lamentation,</l>
    <l>Through just disdain that death among you brought</l>
    <l>And put an end unto your joyous life,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Was honoured in itself and its companions.</l>
    <l>O Buondelmonte, how in evil hour</l>
    <l>Thou fled'st the bridal at another's promptings!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Many would be rejoicing who are sad,</l>
    <l>If God had thee surrendered to the Ema</l>
    <l>The first time that thou camest to the city.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But it behoved the mutilated stone</l>
    <l>Which guards the bridge, that Florence should provide</l>
    <l>A victim in her latest hour of peace.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With all these families, and others with them,</l>
    <l>Florence beheld I in so great repose,</l>
    <l>That no occasion had she whence to weep;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With all these families beheld so just</l>
    <l>And glorious her people, that the lily</l>
    <l>Never upon the spear was placed reversed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor by division was vermilion made.&quot;</l>
