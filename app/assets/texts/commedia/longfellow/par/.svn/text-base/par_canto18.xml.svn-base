  <p>
    <l>Now was alone rejoicing in its word</l>
    <l>That soul beatified, and I was tasting</l>
    <l>My own, the bitter tempering with the sweet,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the Lady who to God was leading me</l>
    <l>Said: &quot;Change thy thought; consider that I am</l>
    <l>Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Unto the loving accents of my comfort</l>
    <l>I turned me round, and then what love I saw</l>
    <l>Within those holy eyes I here relinquish;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not only that my language I distrust,</l>
    <l>But that my mind cannot return so far</l>
    <l>Above itself, unless another guide it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus much upon that point can I repeat,</l>
    <l>That, her again beholding, my affection</l>
    <l>From every other longing was released.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>While the eternal pleasure, which direct</l>
    <l>Rayed upon Beatrice, from her fair face</l>
    <l>Contented me with its reflected aspect,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Conquering me with the radiance of a smile,</l>
    <l>She said to me, &quot;Turn thee about and listen;</l>
    <l>Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as sometimes here do we behold</l>
    <l>The affection in the look, if it be such</l>
    <l>That all the soul is wrapt away by it,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So, by the flaming of the effulgence holy</l>
    <l>To which I turned, I recognized therein</l>
    <l>The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And it began: &quot;In this fifth resting-place</l>
    <l>Upon the tree that liveth by its summit,</l>
    <l>And aye bears fruit, and never loses leaf,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Are blessed spirits that below, ere yet</l>
    <l>They came to Heaven, were of such great renown</l>
    <l>That every Muse therewith would affluent be.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore look thou upon the cross's horns;</l>
    <l>He whom I now shall name will there enact</l>
    <l>What doth within a cloud its own swift fire.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw athwart the Cross a splendour drawn</l>
    <l>By naming Joshua, (even as he did it,)</l>
    <l>Nor noted I the word before the deed;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And at the name of the great Maccabee</l>
    <l>I saw another move itself revolving,</l>
    <l>And gladness was the whip unto that top.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Likewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando,</l>
    <l>Two of them my regard attentive followed</l>
    <l>As followeth the eye its falcon flying.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>William thereafterward, and Renouard,</l>
    <l>And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight</l>
    <l>Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then, moved and mingled with the other lights,</l>
    <l>The soul that had addressed me showed how great</l>
    <l>An artist 'twas among the heavenly singers.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To my right side I turned myself around,</l>
    <l>My duty to behold in Beatrice</l>
    <l>Either by words or gesture signified;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And so translucent I beheld her eyes,</l>
    <l>So full of pleasure, that her countenance</l>
    <l>Surpassed its other and its latest wont.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as, by feeling greater delectation,</l>
    <l>A man in doing good from day to day</l>
    <l>Becomes aware his virtue is increasing,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So I became aware that my gyration</l>
    <l>With heaven together had increased its arc,</l>
    <l>That miracle beholding more adorned.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And such as is the change, in little lapse</l>
    <l>Of time, in a pale woman, when her face</l>
    <l>Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,</l>
    <l>Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star,</l>
    <l>The sixth, which to itself had gathered me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within that Jovial torch did I behold</l>
    <l>The sparkling of the love which was therein</l>
    <l>Delineate our language to mine eyes.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And even as birds uprisen from the shore,</l>
    <l>As in congratulation o'er their food,</l>
    <l>Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So from within those lights the holy creatures</l>
    <l>Sang flying to and fro, and in their figures</l>
    <l>Made of themselves now D, now I, now L.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>First singing they to their own music moved;</l>
    <l>Then one becoming of these characters,</l>
    <l>A little while they rested and were silent.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O divine Pegasea, thou who genius</l>
    <l>Dost glorious make, and render it long-lived,</l>
    <l>And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Illume me with thyself, that I may bring</l>
    <l>Their figures out as I have them conceived!</l>
    <l>Apparent be thy power in these brief verses!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Themselves then they displayed in five times seven</l>
    <l>Vowels and consonants; and I observed</l>
    <l>The parts as they seemed spoken unto me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'Diligite justitiam,' these were</l>
    <l>First verb and noun of all that was depicted;</l>
    <l>'Qui judicatis terram' were the last.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereafter in the M of the fifth word</l>
    <l>Remained they so arranged, that Jupiter</l>
    <l>Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And other lights I saw descend where was</l>
    <l>The summit of the M, and pause there singing</l>
    <l>The good, I think, that draws them to itself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then, as in striking upon burning logs</l>
    <l>Upward there fly innumerable sparks,</l>
    <l>Whence fools are wont to look for auguries,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>More than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise,</l>
    <l>And to ascend, some more, and others less,</l>
    <l>Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And, each one being quiet in its place,</l>
    <l>The head and neck beheld I of an eagle</l>
    <l>Delineated by that inlaid fire.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He who there paints has none to be his guide;</l>
    <l>But Himself guides; and is from Him remembered</l>
    <l>That virtue which is form unto the nest.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The other beatitude, that contented seemed</l>
    <l>At first to bloom a lily on the M,</l>
    <l>By a slight motion followed out the imprint.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O gentle star! what and how many gems</l>
    <l>Did demonstrate to me, that all our justice</l>
    <l>Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Wherefore I pray the Mind, in which begin</l>
    <l>Thy motion and thy virtue, to regard</l>
    <l>Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So that a second time it now be wroth</l>
    <l>With buying and with selling in the temple</l>
    <l>Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O soldiery of heaven, whom I contemplate,</l>
    <l>Implore for those who are upon the earth</l>
    <l>All gone astray after the bad example!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Once 'twas the custom to make war with swords;</l>
    <l>But now 'tis made by taking here and there</l>
    <l>The bread the pitying Father shuts from none.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Yet thou, who writest but to cancel, think</l>
    <l>That Peter and that Paul, who for this vineyard</l>
    <l>Which thou art spoiling died, are still alive!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Well canst thou say: &quot;So steadfast my desire</l>
    <l>Is unto him who willed to live alone,</l>
    <l>And for a dance was led to martyrdom,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That I know not the Fisherman nor Paul.&quot;</l>
