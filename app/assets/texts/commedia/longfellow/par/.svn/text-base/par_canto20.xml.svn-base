  <p>
    <l>When he who all the world illuminates</l>
    <l>Out of our hemisphere so far descends</l>
    <l>That on all sides the daylight is consumed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The heaven, that erst by him alone was kindled,</l>
    <l>Doth suddenly reveal itself again</l>
    <l>By many lights, wherein is one resplendent.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And came into my mind this act of heaven,</l>
    <l>When the ensign of the world and of its leaders</l>
    <l>Had silent in the blessed beak become;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because those living luminaries all,</l>
    <l>By far more luminous, did songs begin</l>
    <l>Lapsing and falling from my memory.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O gentle Love, that with a smile dost cloak thee,</l>
    <l>How ardent in those sparks didst thou appear,</l>
    <l>That had the breath alone of holy thoughts!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After the precious and pellucid crystals,</l>
    <l>With which begemmed the sixth light I beheld,</l>
    <l>Silence imposed on the angelic bells,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I seemed to hear the murmuring of a river</l>
    <l>That clear descendeth down from rock to rock,</l>
    <l>Showing the affluence of its mountain-top.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as the sound upon the cithern's neck</l>
    <l>Taketh its form, and as upon the vent</l>
    <l>Of rustic pipe the wind that enters it,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even thus, relieved from the delay of waiting,</l>
    <l>That murmuring of the eagle mounted up</l>
    <l>Along its neck, as if it had been hollow.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There it became a voice, and issued thence</l>
    <l>From out its beak, in such a form of words</l>
    <l>As the heart waited for wherein I wrote them.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;The part in me which sees and bears the sun</l>
    <l>In mortal eagles,&quot; it began to me,</l>
    <l>&quot;Now fixedly must needs be looked upon;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For of the fires of which I make my figure,</l>
    <l>Those whence the eye doth sparkle in my head</l>
    <l>Of all their orders the supremest are.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He who is shining in the midst as pupil</l>
    <l>Was once the singer of the Holy Spirit,</l>
    <l>Who bore the ark from city unto city;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now knoweth he the merit of his song,</l>
    <l>In so far as effect of his own counsel,</l>
    <l>By the reward which is commensurate.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of five, that make a circle for my brow,</l>
    <l>He that approacheth nearest to my beak</l>
    <l>Did the poor widow for her son console;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now knoweth he how dearly it doth cost</l>
    <l>Not following Christ, by the experience</l>
    <l>Of this sweet life and of its opposite.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He who comes next in the circumference</l>
    <l>Of which I speak, upon its highest arc,</l>
    <l>Did death postpone by penitence sincere;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now knoweth he that the eternal judgment</l>
    <l>Suffers no change, albeit worthy prayer</l>
    <l>Maketh below to-morrow of to-day.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The next who follows, with the laws and me,</l>
    <l>Under the good intent that bore bad fruit</l>
    <l>Became a Greek by ceding to the pastor;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now knoweth he how all the ill deduced</l>
    <l>From his good action is not harmful to him,</l>
    <l>Although the world thereby may be destroyed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he, whom in the downward arc thou seest,</l>
    <l>Guglielmo was, whom the same land deplores</l>
    <l>That weepeth Charles and Frederick yet alive;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now knoweth he how heaven enamoured is</l>
    <l>With a just king; and in the outward show</l>
    <l>Of his effulgence he reveals it still.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Who would believe, down in the errant world,</l>
    <l>That e'er the Trojan Ripheus in this round</l>
    <l>Could be the fifth one of the holy lights?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now knoweth he enough of what the world</l>
    <l>Has not the power to see of grace divine,</l>
    <l>Although his sight may not discern the bottom.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Like as a lark that in the air expatiates,</l>
    <l>First singing and then silent with content</l>
    <l>Of the last sweetness that doth satisfy her,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such seemed to me the image of the imprint</l>
    <l>Of the eternal pleasure, by whose will</l>
    <l>Doth everything become the thing it is.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And notwithstanding to my doubt I was</l>
    <l>As glass is to the colour that invests it,</l>
    <l>To wait the time in silence it endured not,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But forth from out my mouth, &quot;What things are these?&quot;</l>
    <l>Extorted with the force of its own weight;</l>
    <l>Whereat I saw great joy of coruscation.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereafterward with eye still more enkindled</l>
    <l>The blessed standard made to me reply,</l>
    <l>To keep me not in wonderment suspended:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;I see that thou believest in these things</l>
    <l>Because I say them, but thou seest not how;</l>
    <l>So that, although believed in, they are hidden.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou doest as he doth who a thing by name</l>
    <l>Well apprehendeth, but its quiddity</l>
    <l>Cannot perceive, unless another show it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'Regnum coelorum' suffereth violence</l>
    <l>From fervent love, and from that living hope</l>
    <l>That overcometh the Divine volition;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not in the guise that man o'ercometh man,</l>
    <l>But conquers it because it will be conquered,</l>
    <l>And conquered conquers by benignity.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The first life of the eyebrow and the fifth</l>
    <l>Cause thee astonishment, because with them</l>
    <l>Thou seest the region of the angels painted.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>They passed not from their bodies, as thou thinkest,</l>
    <l>Gentiles, but Christians in the steadfast faith</l>
    <l>Of feet that were to suffer and had suffered.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For one from Hell, where no one e'er turns back</l>
    <l>Unto good will, returned unto his bones,</l>
    <l>And that of living hope was the reward,--</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of living hope, that placed its efficacy</l>
    <l>In prayers to God made to resuscitate him,</l>
    <l>So that 'twere possible to move his will.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The glorious soul concerning which I speak,</l>
    <l>Returning to the flesh, where brief its stay,</l>
    <l>Believed in Him who had the power to aid it;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And, in believing, kindled to such fire</l>
    <l>Of genuine love, that at the second death</l>
    <l>Worthy it was to come unto this joy.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The other one, through grace, that from so deep</l>
    <l>A fountain wells that never hath the eye</l>
    <l>Of any creature reached its primal wave,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Set all his love below on righteousness;</l>
    <l>Wherefore from grace to grace did God unclose</l>
    <l>His eye to our redemption yet to be,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence he believed therein, and suffered not</l>
    <l>From that day forth the stench of paganism,</l>
    <l>And he reproved therefor the folk perverse.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Those Maidens three, whom at the right-hand wheel</l>
    <l>Thou didst behold, were unto him for baptism</l>
    <l>More than a thousand years before baptizing.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O thou predestination, how remote</l>
    <l>Thy root is from the aspect of all those</l>
    <l>Who the First Cause do not behold entire!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And you, O mortals! hold yourselves restrained</l>
    <l>In judging; for ourselves, who look on God,</l>
    <l>We do not know as yet all the elect;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And sweet to us is such a deprivation,</l>
    <l>Because our good in this good is made perfect,</l>
    <l>That whatsoe'er God wills, we also will.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After this manner by that shape divine,</l>
    <l>To make clear in me my short-sightedness,</l>
    <l>Was given to me a pleasant medicine;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as good singer a good lutanist</l>
    <l>Accompanies with vibrations of the chords,</l>
    <l>Whereby more pleasantness the song acquires,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So, while it spake, do I remember me</l>
    <l>That I beheld both of those blessed lights,</l>
    <l>Even as the winking of the eyes concords,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Moving unto the words their little flames.</l>
