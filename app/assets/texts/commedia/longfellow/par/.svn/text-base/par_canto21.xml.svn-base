  <p>
    <l>Already on my Lady's face mine eyes</l>
    <l>Again were fastened, and with these my mind,</l>
    <l>And from all other purpose was withdrawn;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And she smiled not; but &quot;If I were to smile,&quot;</l>
    <l>She unto me began, &quot;thou wouldst become</l>
    <l>Like Semele, when she was turned to ashes.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because my beauty, that along the stairs</l>
    <l>Of the eternal palace more enkindles,</l>
    <l>As thou hast seen, the farther we ascend,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If it were tempered not, is so resplendent</l>
    <l>That all thy mortal power in its effulgence</l>
    <l>Would seem a leaflet that the thunder crushes.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We are uplifted to the seventh splendour,</l>
    <l>That underneath the burning Lion's breast</l>
    <l>Now radiates downward mingled with his power.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Fix in direction of thine eyes the mind,</l>
    <l>And make of them a mirror for the figure</l>
    <l>That in this mirror shall appear to thee.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He who could know what was the pasturage</l>
    <l>My sight had in that blessed countenance,</l>
    <l>When I transferred me to another care,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Would recognize how grateful was to me</l>
    <l>Obedience unto my celestial escort,</l>
    <l>By counterpoising one side with the other.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within the crystal which, around the world</l>
    <l>Revolving, bears the name of its dear leader,</l>
    <l>Under whom every wickedness lay dead,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Coloured like gold, on which the sunshine gleams,</l>
    <l>A stairway I beheld to such a height</l>
    <l>Uplifted, that mine eye pursued it not.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Likewise beheld I down the steps descending</l>
    <l>So many splendours, that I thought each light</l>
    <l>That in the heaven appears was there diffused.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as accordant with their natural custom</l>
    <l>The rooks together at the break of day</l>
    <l>Bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then some of them fly off without return,</l>
    <l>Others come back to where they started from,</l>
    <l>And others, wheeling round, still keep at home;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such fashion it appeared to me was there</l>
    <l>Within the sparkling that together came,</l>
    <l>As soon as on a certain step it struck,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And that which nearest unto us remained</l>
    <l>Became so clear, that in my thought I said,</l>
    <l>&quot;Well I perceive the love thou showest me;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But she, from whom I wait the how and when</l>
    <l>Of speech and silence, standeth still; whence I</l>
    <l>Against desire do well if I ask not.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>She thereupon, who saw my silentness</l>
    <l>In the sight of Him who seeth everything,</l>
    <l>Said unto me, &quot;Let loose thy warm desire.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I began: &quot;No merit of my own</l>
    <l>Renders me worthy of response from thee;</l>
    <l>But for her sake who granteth me the asking,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou blessed life that dost remain concealed</l>
    <l>In thy beatitude, make known to me</l>
    <l>The cause which draweth thee so near my side;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And tell me why is silent in this wheel</l>
    <l>The dulcet symphony of Paradise,</l>
    <l>That through the rest below sounds so devoutly.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight,&quot;</l>
    <l>It answer made to me; &quot;they sing not here,</l>
    <l>For the same cause that Beatrice has not smiled.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus far adown the holy stairway's steps</l>
    <l>Have I descended but to give thee welcome</l>
    <l>With words, and with the light that mantles me;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor did more love cause me to be more ready,</l>
    <l>For love as much and more up there is burning,</l>
    <l>As doth the flaming manifest to thee.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But the high charity, that makes us servants</l>
    <l>Prompt to the counsel which controls the world,</l>
    <l>Allotteth here, even as thou dost observe.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;I see full well,&quot; said I, &quot;O sacred lamp!</l>
    <l>How love unfettered in this court sufficeth</l>
    <l>To follow the eternal Providence;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But this is what seems hard for me to see,</l>
    <l>Wherefore predestinate wast thou alone</l>
    <l>Unto this office from among thy consorts.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>No sooner had I come to the last word,</l>
    <l>Than of its middle made the light a centre,</l>
    <l>Whirling itself about like a swift millstone.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When answer made the love that was therein:</l>
    <l>&quot;On me directed is a light divine,</l>
    <l>Piercing through this in which I am embosomed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of which the virtue with my sight conjoined</l>
    <l>Lifts me above myself so far, I see</l>
    <l>The supreme essence from which this is drawn.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence comes the joyfulness with which I flame,</l>
    <l>For to my sight, as far as it is clear,</l>
    <l>The clearness of the flame I equal make.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But that soul in the heaven which is most pure,</l>
    <l>That seraph which his eye on God most fixes,</l>
    <l>Could this demand of thine not satisfy;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because so deeply sinks in the abyss</l>
    <l>Of the eternal statute what thou askest,</l>
    <l>From all created sight it is cut off.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And to the mortal world, when thou returnest,</l>
    <l>This carry back, that it may not presume</l>
    <l>Longer tow'rd such a goal to move its feet.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The mind, that shineth here, on earth doth smoke;</l>
    <l>From this observe how can it do below</l>
    <l>That which it cannot though the heaven assume it?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such limit did its words prescribe to me,</l>
    <l>The question I relinquished, and restricted</l>
    <l>Myself to ask it humbly who it was.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Between two shores of Italy rise cliffs,</l>
    <l>And not far distant from thy native place,</l>
    <l>So high, the thunders far below them sound,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And form a ridge that Catria is called,</l>
    <l>'Neath which is consecrate a hermitage</l>
    <l>Wont to be dedicate to worship only.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus unto me the third speech recommenced,</l>
    <l>And then, continuing, it said: &quot;Therein</l>
    <l>Unto God's service I became so steadfast,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That feeding only on the juice of olives</l>
    <l>Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts,</l>
    <l>Contented in my thoughts contemplative.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That cloister used to render to these heavens</l>
    <l>Abundantly, and now is empty grown,</l>
    <l>So that perforce it soon must be revealed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I in that place was Peter Damiano;</l>
    <l>And Peter the Sinner was I in the house</l>
    <l>Of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Little of mortal life remained to me,</l>
    <l>When I was called and dragged forth to the hat</l>
    <l>Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Came Cephas, and the mighty Vessel came</l>
    <l>Of the Holy Spirit, meagre and barefooted,</l>
    <l>Taking the food of any hostelry.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now some one to support them on each side</l>
    <l>The modern shepherds need, and some to lead them,</l>
    <l>So heavy are they, and to hold their trains.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks,</l>
    <l>So that two beasts go underneath one skin;</l>
    <l>O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>At this voice saw I many little flames</l>
    <l>From step to step descending and revolving,</l>
    <l>And every revolution made them fairer.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Round about this one came they and stood still,</l>
    <l>And a cry uttered of so loud a sound,</l>
    <l>It here could find no parallel, nor I</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Distinguished it, the thunder so o'ercame me.</l>
