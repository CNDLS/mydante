  <p>
    <l>While I was doubting for my vision quenched,</l>
    <l>Out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it</l>
    <l>Issued a breathing, that attentive made me,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Saying: &quot;While thou recoverest the sense</l>
    <l>Of seeing which in me thou hast consumed,</l>
    <l>'Tis well that speaking thou shouldst compensate it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Begin then, and declare to what thy soul</l>
    <l>Is aimed, and count it for a certainty,</l>
    <l>Sight is in thee bewildered and not dead;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because the Lady, who through this divine</l>
    <l>Region conducteth thee, has in her look</l>
    <l>The power the hand of Ananias had.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I said: &quot;As pleaseth her, or soon or late</l>
    <l>Let the cure come to eyes that portals were</l>
    <l>When she with fire I ever burn with entered.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Good, that gives contentment to this Court,</l>
    <l>The Alpha and Omega is of all</l>
    <l>The writing that love reads me low or loud.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The selfsame voice, that taken had from me</l>
    <l>The terror of the sudden dazzlement,</l>
    <l>To speak still farther put it in my thought;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And said: &quot;In verity with finer sieve</l>
    <l>Behoveth thee to sift; thee it behoveth</l>
    <l>To say who aimed thy bow at such a target.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I: &quot;By philosophic arguments,</l>
    <l>And by authority that hence descends,</l>
    <l>Such love must needs imprint itself in me;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For Good, so far as good, when comprehended</l>
    <l>Doth straight enkindle love, and so much greater</l>
    <l>As more of goodness in itself it holds;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then to that Essence (whose is such advantage</l>
    <l>That every good which out of it is found</l>
    <l>Is nothing but a ray of its own light)</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>More than elsewhither must the mind be moved</l>
    <l>Of every one, in loving, who discerns</l>
    <l>The truth in which this evidence is founded.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such truth he to my intellect reveals</l>
    <l>Who demonstrates to me the primal love</l>
    <l>Of all the sempiternal substances.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The voice reveals it of the truthful Author,</l>
    <l>Who says to Moses, speaking of Himself,</l>
    <l>'I will make all my goodness pass before thee.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou too revealest it to me, beginning</l>
    <l>The loud Evangel, that proclaims the secret</l>
    <l>Of heaven to earth above all other edict.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I heard say: &quot;By human intellect</l>
    <l>And by authority concordant with it,</l>
    <l>Of all thy loves reserve for God the highest.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But say again if other cords thou feelest,</l>
    <l>Draw thee towards Him, that thou mayst proclaim</l>
    <l>With how many teeth this love is biting thee.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The holy purpose of the Eagle of Christ</l>
    <l>Not latent was, nay, rather I perceived</l>
    <l>Whither he fain would my profession lead.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore I recommenced: &quot;All of those bites</l>
    <l>Which have the power to turn the heart to God</l>
    <l>Unto my charity have been concurrent.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The being of the world, and my own being,</l>
    <l>The death which He endured that I may live,</l>
    <l>And that which all the faithful hope, as I do,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With the forementioned vivid consciousness</l>
    <l>Have drawn me from the sea of love perverse,</l>
    <l>And of the right have placed me on the shore.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The leaves, wherewith embowered is all the garden</l>
    <l>Of the Eternal Gardener, do I love</l>
    <l>As much as he has granted them of good.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As soon as I had ceased, a song most sweet</l>
    <l>Throughout the heaven resounded, and my Lady</l>
    <l>Said with the others, &quot;Holy, holy, holy!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as at some keen light one wakes from sleep</l>
    <l>By reason of the visual spirit that runs</l>
    <l>Unto the splendour passed from coat to coat,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he who wakes abhorreth what he sees,</l>
    <l>So all unconscious is his sudden waking,</l>
    <l>Until the judgment cometh to his aid,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So from before mine eyes did Beatrice</l>
    <l>Chase every mote with radiance of her own,</l>
    <l>That cast its light a thousand miles and more.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence better after than before I saw,</l>
    <l>And in a kind of wonderment I asked</l>
    <l>About a fourth light that I saw with us.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And said my Lady: &quot;There within those rays</l>
    <l>Gazes upon its Maker the first soul</l>
    <l>That ever the first virtue did create.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as the bough that downward bends its top</l>
    <l>At transit of the wind, and then is lifted</l>
    <l>By its own virtue, which inclines it upward,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Likewise did I, the while that she was speaking,</l>
    <l>Being amazed, and then I was made bold</l>
    <l>By a desire to speak wherewith I burned.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I began: &quot;O apple, that mature</l>
    <l>Alone hast been produced, O ancient father,</l>
    <l>To whom each wife is daughter and daughter-in-law,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Devoutly as I can I supplicate thee</l>
    <l>That thou wouldst speak to me; thou seest my wish;</l>
    <l>And I, to hear thee quickly, speak it not.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Sometimes an animal, when covered, struggles</l>
    <l>So that his impulse needs must be apparent,</l>
    <l>By reason of the wrappage following it;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And in like manner the primeval soul</l>
    <l>Made clear to me athwart its covering</l>
    <l>How jubilant it was to give me pleasure.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then breathed: &quot;Without thy uttering it to me,</l>
    <l>Thine inclination better I discern</l>
    <l>Than thou whatever thing is surest to thee;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For I behold it in the truthful mirror,</l>
    <l>That of Himself all things parhelion makes,</l>
    <l>And none makes Him parhelion of itself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou fain wouldst hear how long ago God placed me</l>
    <l>Within the lofty garden, where this Lady</l>
    <l>Unto so long a stairway thee disposed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure,</l>
    <l>And of the great disdain the proper cause,</l>
    <l>And the language that I used and that I made.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now, son of mine, the tasting of the tree</l>
    <l>Not in itself was cause of so great exile,</l>
    <l>But solely the o'erstepping of the bounds.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There, whence thy Lady moved Virgilius,</l>
    <l>Four thousand and three hundred and two circuits</l>
    <l>Made by the sun, this Council I desired;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And him I saw return to all the lights</l>
    <l>Of his highway nine hundred times and thirty,</l>
    <l>Whilst I upon the earth was tarrying.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The language that I spake was quite extinct</l>
    <l>Before that in the work interminable</l>
    <l>The people under Nimrod were employed;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For nevermore result of reasoning</l>
    <l>(Because of human pleasure that doth change,</l>
    <l>Obedient to the heavens) was durable.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A natural action is it that man speaks;</l>
    <l>But whether thus or thus, doth nature leave</l>
    <l>To your own art, as seemeth best to you.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ere I descended to the infernal anguish,</l>
    <l>'El' was on earth the name of the Chief Good,</l>
    <l>From whom comes all the joy that wraps me round</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'Eli' he then was called, and that is proper,</l>
    <l>Because the use of men is like a leaf</l>
    <l>On bough, which goeth and another cometh.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon the mount that highest o'er the wave</l>
    <l>Rises was I, in life or pure or sinful,</l>
    <l>From the first hour to that which is the second,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As the sun changes quadrant, to the sixth.&quot;</l>
