  <p>
    <l>After the truth against the present life</l>
    <l>Of miserable mortals was unfolded</l>
    <l>By her who doth imparadise my mind,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As in a looking-glass a taper's flame</l>
    <l>He sees who from behind is lighted by it,</l>
    <l>Before he has it in his sight or thought,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And turns him round to see if so the glass</l>
    <l>Tell him the truth, and sees that it accords</l>
    <l>Therewith as doth a music with its metre,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In similar wise my memory recollecteth</l>
    <l>That I did, looking into those fair eyes,</l>
    <l>Of which Love made the springes to ensnare me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as I turned me round, and mine were touched</l>
    <l>By that which is apparent in that volume,</l>
    <l>Whenever on its gyre we gaze intent,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A point beheld I, that was raying out</l>
    <l>Light so acute, the sight which it enkindles</l>
    <l>Must close perforce before such great acuteness.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And whatsoever star seems smallest here</l>
    <l>Would seem to be a moon, if placed beside it.</l>
    <l>As one star with another star is placed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Perhaps at such a distance as appears</l>
    <l>A halo cincturing the light that paints it,</l>
    <l>When densest is the vapour that sustains it,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus distant round the point a circle of fire</l>
    <l>So swiftly whirled, that it would have surpassed</l>
    <l>Whatever motion soonest girds the world;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And this was by another circumcinct,</l>
    <l>That by a third, the third then by a fourth,</l>
    <l>By a fifth the fourth, and then by a sixth the fifth;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The seventh followed thereupon in width</l>
    <l>So ample now, that Juno's messenger</l>
    <l>Entire would be too narrow to contain it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even so the eighth and ninth; and every one</l>
    <l>More slowly moved, according as it was</l>
    <l>In number distant farther from the first.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And that one had its flame most crystalline</l>
    <l>From which less distant was the stainless spark,</l>
    <l>I think because more with its truth imbued.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My Lady, who in my anxiety</l>
    <l>Beheld me much perplexed, said: &quot;From that point</l>
    <l>Dependent is the heaven and nature all.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Behold that circle most conjoined to it,</l>
    <l>And know thou, that its motion is so swift</l>
    <l>Through burning love whereby it is spurred on.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I to her: &quot;If the world were arranged</l>
    <l>In the order which I see in yonder wheels,</l>
    <l>What's set before me would have satisfied me;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But in the world of sense we can perceive</l>
    <l>That evermore the circles are diviner</l>
    <l>As they are from the centre more remote</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Wherefore if my desire is to be ended</l>
    <l>In this miraculous and angelic temple,</l>
    <l>That has for confines only love and light,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To hear behoves me still how the example</l>
    <l>And the exemplar go not in one fashion,</l>
    <l>Since for myself in vain I contemplate it.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;If thine own fingers unto such a knot</l>
    <l>Be insufficient, it is no great wonder,</l>
    <l>So hard hath it become for want of trying.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My Lady thus; then said she: &quot;Do thou take</l>
    <l>What I shall tell thee, if thou wouldst be sated,</l>
    <l>And exercise on that thy subtlety.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The circles corporal are wide and narrow</l>
    <l>According to the more or less of virtue</l>
    <l>Which is distributed through all their parts.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The greater goodness works the greater weal,</l>
    <l>The greater weal the greater body holds,</l>
    <l>If perfect equally are all its parts.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore this one which sweeps along with it</l>
    <l>The universe sublime, doth correspond</l>
    <l>Unto the circle which most loves and knows.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On which account, if thou unto the virtue</l>
    <l>Apply thy measure, not to the appearance</l>
    <l>Of substances that unto thee seem round,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou wilt behold a marvellous agreement,</l>
    <l>Of more to greater, and of less to smaller,</l>
    <l>In every heaven, with its Intelligence.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as remaineth splendid and serene</l>
    <l>The hemisphere of air, when Boreas</l>
    <l>Is blowing from that cheek where he is mildest,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because is purified and resolved the rack</l>
    <l>That erst disturbed it, till the welkin laughs</l>
    <l>With all the beauties of its pageantry;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus did I likewise, after that my Lady</l>
    <l>Had me provided with her clear response,</l>
    <l>And like a star in heaven the truth was seen.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And soon as to a stop her words had come,</l>
    <l>Not otherwise does iron scintillate</l>
    <l>When molten, than those circles scintillated.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Their coruscation all the sparks repeated,</l>
    <l>And they so many were, their number makes</l>
    <l>More millions than the doubling of the chess.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I heard them sing hosanna choir by choir</l>
    <l>To the fixed point which holds them at the 'Ubi,'</l>
    <l>And ever will, where they have ever been.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And she, who saw the dubious meditations</l>
    <l>Within my mind, &quot;The primal circles,&quot; said,</l>
    <l>&quot;Have shown thee Seraphim and Cherubim.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus rapidly they follow their own bonds,</l>
    <l>To be as like the point as most they can,</l>
    <l>And can as far as they are high in vision.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Those other Loves, that round about them go,</l>
    <l>Thrones of the countenance divine are called,</l>
    <l>Because they terminate the primal Triad.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And thou shouldst know that they all have delight</l>
    <l>As much as their own vision penetrates</l>
    <l>The Truth, in which all intellect finds rest.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From this it may be seen how blessedness</l>
    <l>Is founded in the faculty which sees,</l>
    <l>And not in that which loves, and follows next;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And of this seeing merit is the measure,</l>
    <l>Which is brought forth by grace, and by good will;</l>
    <l>Thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The second Triad, which is germinating</l>
    <l>In such wise in this sempiternal spring,</l>
    <l>That no nocturnal Aries despoils,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Perpetually hosanna warbles forth</l>
    <l>With threefold melody, that sounds in three</l>
    <l>Orders of joy, with which it is intrined.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The three Divine are in this hierarchy,</l>
    <l>First the Dominions, and the Virtues next;</l>
    <l>And the third order is that of the Powers.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then in the dances twain penultimate</l>
    <l>The Principalities and Archangels wheel;</l>
    <l>The last is wholly of angelic sports.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>These orders upward all of them are gazing,</l>
    <l>And downward so prevail, that unto God</l>
    <l>They all attracted are and all attract.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And Dionysius with so great desire</l>
    <l>To contemplate these Orders set himself,</l>
    <l>He named them and distinguished them as I do.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But Gregory afterwards dissented from him;</l>
    <l>Wherefore, as soon as he unclosed his eyes</l>
    <l>Within this heaven, he at himself did smile.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if so much of secret truth a mortal</l>
    <l>Proffered on earth, I would not have thee marvel,</l>
    <l>For he who saw it here revealed it to him,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With much more of the truth about these circles.&quot;</l>
