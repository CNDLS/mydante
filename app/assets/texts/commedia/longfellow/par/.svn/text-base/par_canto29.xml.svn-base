  <p>
    <l>At what time both the children of Latona,</l>
    <l>Surmounted by the Ram and by the Scales,</l>
    <l>Together make a zone of the horizon,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As long as from the time the zenith holds them</l>
    <l>In equipoise, till from that girdle both</l>
    <l>Changing their hemisphere disturb the balance,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So long, her face depicted with a smile,</l>
    <l>Did Beatrice keep silence while she gazed</l>
    <l>Fixedly at the point which had o'ercome me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then she began: &quot;I say, and I ask not</l>
    <l>What thou dost wish to hear, for I have seen it</l>
    <l>Where centres every When and every 'Ubi.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not to acquire some good unto himself,</l>
    <l>Which is impossible, but that his splendour</l>
    <l>In its resplendency may say, 'Subsisto,'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In his eternity outside of time,</l>
    <l>Outside all other limits, as it pleased him,</l>
    <l>Into new Loves the Eternal Love unfolded.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor as if torpid did he lie before;</l>
    <l>For neither after nor before proceeded</l>
    <l>The going forth of God upon these waters.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Matter and Form unmingled and conjoined</l>
    <l>Came into being that had no defect,</l>
    <l>E'en as three arrows from a three-stringed bow.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as in glass, in amber, or in crystal</l>
    <l>A sunbeam flashes so, that from its coming</l>
    <l>To its full being is no interval,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So from its Lord did the triform effect</l>
    <l>Ray forth into its being all together,</l>
    <l>Without discrimination of beginning.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Order was con-created and constructed</l>
    <l>In substances, and summit of the world</l>
    <l>Were those wherein the pure act was produced.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Pure potentiality held the lowest part;</l>
    <l>Midway bound potentiality with act</l>
    <l>Such bond that it shall never be unbound.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Jerome has written unto you of angels</l>
    <l>Created a long lapse of centuries</l>
    <l>Or ever yet the other world was made;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But written is this truth in many places</l>
    <l>By writers of the Holy Ghost, and thou</l>
    <l>Shalt see it, if thou lookest well thereat.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And even reason seeth it somewhat,</l>
    <l>For it would not concede that for so long</l>
    <l>Could be the motors without their perfection.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now dost thou know both where and when these Loves</l>
    <l>Created were, and how; so that extinct</l>
    <l>In thy desire already are three fires.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor could one reach, in counting, unto twenty</l>
    <l>So swiftly, as a portion of these angels</l>
    <l>Disturbed the subject of your elements.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The rest remained, and they began this art</l>
    <l>Which thou discernest, with so great delight</l>
    <l>That never from their circling do they cease.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The occasion of the fall was the accursed</l>
    <l>Presumption of that One, whom thou hast seen</l>
    <l>By all the burden of the world constrained.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Those whom thou here beholdest modest were</l>
    <l>To recognise themselves as of that goodness</l>
    <l>Which made them apt for so much understanding;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On which account their vision was exalted</l>
    <l>By the enlightening grace and their own merit,</l>
    <l>So that they have a full and steadfast will.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I would not have thee doubt, but certain be,</l>
    <l>'Tis meritorious to receive this grace,</l>
    <l>According as the affection opens to it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now round about in this consistory</l>
    <l>Much mayst thou contemplate, if these my words</l>
    <l>Be gathered up, without all further aid.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But since upon the earth, throughout your schools,</l>
    <l>They teach that such is the angelic nature</l>
    <l>That it doth hear, and recollect, and will,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>More will I say, that thou mayst see unmixed</l>
    <l>The truth that is confounded there below,</l>
    <l>Equivocating in such like prelections.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>These substances, since in God's countenance</l>
    <l>They jocund were, turned not away their sight</l>
    <l>From that wherefrom not anything is hidden;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence they have not their vision intercepted</l>
    <l>By object new, and hence they do not need</l>
    <l>To recollect, through interrupted thought.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So that below, not sleeping, people dream,</l>
    <l>Believing they speak truth, and not believing;</l>
    <l>And in the last is greater sin and shame.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Below you do not journey by one path</l>
    <l>Philosophising; so transporteth you</l>
    <l>Love of appearance and the thought thereof.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And even this above here is endured</l>
    <l>With less disdain, than when is set aside</l>
    <l>The Holy Writ, or when it is distorted.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>They think not there how much of blood it costs</l>
    <l>To sow it in the world, and how he pleases</l>
    <l>Who in humility keeps close to it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Each striveth for appearance, and doth make</l>
    <l>His own inventions; and these treated are</l>
    <l>By preachers, and the Evangel holds its peace.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One sayeth that the moon did backward turn,</l>
    <l>In the Passion of Christ, and interpose herself</l>
    <l>So that the sunlight reached not down below;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And lies; for of its own accord the light</l>
    <l>Hid itself; whence to Spaniards and to Indians,</l>
    <l>As to the Jews, did such eclipse respond.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Florence has not so many Lapi and Bindi</l>
    <l>As fables such as these, that every year</l>
    <l>Are shouted from the pulpit back and forth,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In such wise that the lambs, who do not know,</l>
    <l>Come back from pasture fed upon the wind,</l>
    <l>And not to see the harm doth not excuse them.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Christ did not to his first disciples say,</l>
    <l>'Go forth, and to the world preach idle tales,'</l>
    <l>But unto them a true foundation gave;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And this so loudly sounded from their lips,</l>
    <l>That, in the warfare to enkindle Faith,</l>
    <l>They made of the Evangel shields and lances.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now men go forth with jests and drolleries</l>
    <l>To preach, and if but well the people laugh,</l>
    <l>The hood puffs out, and nothing more is asked.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But in the cowl there nestles such a bird,</l>
    <l>That, if the common people were to see it,</l>
    <l>They would perceive what pardons they confide in,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For which so great on earth has grown the folly,</l>
    <l>That, without proof of any testimony,</l>
    <l>To each indulgence they would flock together.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>By this Saint Anthony his pig doth fatten,</l>
    <l>And many others, who are worse than pigs,</l>
    <l>Paying in money without mark of coinage.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But since we have digressed abundantly,</l>
    <l>Turn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path,</l>
    <l>So that the way be shortened with the time.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This nature doth so multiply itself</l>
    <l>In numbers, that there never yet was speech</l>
    <l>Nor mortal fancy that can go so far.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if thou notest that which is revealed</l>
    <l>By Daniel, thou wilt see that in his thousands</l>
    <l>Number determinate is kept concealed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The primal light, that all irradiates it,</l>
    <l>By modes as many is received therein,</l>
    <l>As are the splendours wherewith it is mated.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence, inasmuch as on the act conceptive</l>
    <l>The affection followeth, of love the sweetness</l>
    <l>Therein diversely fervid is or tepid.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The height behold now and the amplitude</l>
    <l>Of the eternal power, since it hath made</l>
    <l>Itself so many mirrors, where 'tis broken,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One in itself remaining as before.&quot;</l>
