  <p>
    <l>In fashion then as of a snow-white rose</l>
    <l>Displayed itself to me the saintly host,</l>
    <l>Whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But the other host, that flying sees and sings</l>
    <l>The glory of Him who doth enamour it,</l>
    <l>And the goodness that created it so noble,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as a swarm of bees, that sinks in flowers</l>
    <l>One moment, and the next returns again</l>
    <l>To where its labour is to sweetness turned,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Sank into the great flower, that is adorned</l>
    <l>With leaves so many, and thence reascended</l>
    <l>To where its love abideth evermore.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Their faces had they all of living flame,</l>
    <l>And wings of gold, and all the rest so white</l>
    <l>No snow unto that limit doth attain.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From bench to bench, into the flower descending,</l>
    <l>They carried something of the peace and ardour</l>
    <l>Which by the fanning of their flanks they won.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor did the interposing 'twixt the flower</l>
    <l>And what was o'er it of such plenitude</l>
    <l>Of flying shapes impede the sight and splendour;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because the light divine so penetrates</l>
    <l>The universe, according to its merit,</l>
    <l>That naught can be an obstacle against it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This realm secure and full of gladsomeness,</l>
    <l>Crowded with ancient people and with modern,</l>
    <l>Unto one mark had all its look and love.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O Trinal Light, that in a single star</l>
    <l>Sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them,</l>
    <l>Look down upon our tempest here below!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If the barbarians, coming from some region</l>
    <l>That every day by Helice is covered,</l>
    <l>Revolving with her son whom she delights in,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Beholding Rome and all her noble works,</l>
    <l>Were wonder-struck, what time the Lateran</l>
    <l>Above all mortal things was eminent,--</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I who to the divine had from the human,</l>
    <l>From time unto eternity, had come,</l>
    <l>From Florence to a people just and sane,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With what amazement must I have been filled!</l>
    <l>Truly between this and the joy, it was</l>
    <l>My pleasure not to hear, and to be mute.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as a pilgrim who delighteth him</l>
    <l>In gazing round the temple of his vow,</l>
    <l>And hopes some day to retell how it was,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So through the living light my way pursuing</l>
    <l>Directed I mine eyes o'er all the ranks,</l>
    <l>Now up, now down, and now all round about.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Faces I saw of charity persuasive,</l>
    <l>Embellished by His light and their own smile,</l>
    <l>And attitudes adorned with every grace.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The general form of Paradise already</l>
    <l>My glance had comprehended as a whole,</l>
    <l>In no part hitherto remaining fixed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And round I turned me with rekindled wish</l>
    <l>My Lady to interrogate of things</l>
    <l>Concerning which my mind was in suspense.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One thing I meant, another answered me;</l>
    <l>I thought I should see Beatrice, and saw</l>
    <l>An Old Man habited like the glorious people.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O'erflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks</l>
    <l>With joy benign, in attitude of pity</l>
    <l>As to a tender father is becoming.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And &quot;She, where is she?&quot; instantly I said;</l>
    <l>Whence he: &quot;To put an end to thy desire,</l>
    <l>Me Beatrice hath sent from mine own place.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if thou lookest up to the third round</l>
    <l>Of the first rank, again shalt thou behold her</l>
    <l>Upon the throne her merits have assigned her.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Without reply I lifted up mine eyes,</l>
    <l>And saw her, as she made herself a crown</l>
    <l>Reflecting from herself the eternal rays.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not from that region which the highest thunders</l>
    <l>Is any mortal eye so far removed,</l>
    <l>In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As there from Beatrice my sight; but this</l>
    <l>Was nothing unto me; because her image</l>
    <l>Descended not to me by medium blurred.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,</l>
    <l>And who for my salvation didst endure</l>
    <l>In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of whatsoever things I have beheld,</l>
    <l>As coming from thy power and from thy goodness</l>
    <l>I recognise the virtue and the grace.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom,</l>
    <l>By all those ways, by all the expedients,</l>
    <l>Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Preserve towards me thy magnificence,</l>
    <l>So that this soul of mine, which thou hast healed,</l>
    <l>Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus I implored; and she, so far away,</l>
    <l>Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me;</l>
    <l>Then unto the eternal fountain turned.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And said the Old Man holy: &quot;That thou mayst</l>
    <l>Accomplish perfectly thy journeying,</l>
    <l>Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Fly with thine eyes all round about this garden;</l>
    <l>For seeing it will discipline thy sight</l>
    <l>Farther to mount along the ray divine.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And she, the Queen of Heaven, for whom I burn</l>
    <l>Wholly with love, will grant us every grace,</l>
    <l>Because that I her faithful Bernard am.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As he who peradventure from Croatia</l>
    <l>Cometh to gaze at our Veronica,</l>
    <l>Who through its ancient fame is never sated,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But says in thought, the while it is displayed,</l>
    <l>&quot;My Lord, Christ Jesus, God of very God,</l>
    <l>Now was your semblance made like unto this?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even such was I while gazing at the living</l>
    <l>Charity of the man, who in this world</l>
    <l>By contemplation tasted of that peace.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Thou son of grace, this jocund life,&quot; began he,</l>
    <l>&quot;Will not be known to thee by keeping ever</l>
    <l>Thine eyes below here on the lowest place;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But mark the circles to the most remote,</l>
    <l>Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen</l>
    <l>To whom this realm is subject and devoted.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn</l>
    <l>The oriental part of the horizon</l>
    <l>Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale</l>
    <l>To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness</l>
    <l>Surpass in splendour all the other front.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And even as there where we await the pole</l>
    <l>That Phaeton drove badly, blazes more</l>
    <l>The light, and is on either side diminished,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So likewise that pacific oriflamme</l>
    <l>Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side</l>
    <l>In equal measure did the flame abate.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And at that centre, with their wings expanded,</l>
    <l>More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I,</l>
    <l>Each differing in effulgence and in kind.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw there at their sports and at their songs</l>
    <l>A beauty smiling, which the gladness was</l>
    <l>Within the eyes of all the other saints;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if I had in speaking as much wealth</l>
    <l>As in imagining, I should not dare</l>
    <l>To attempt the smallest part of its delight.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Bernard, as soon as he beheld mine eyes</l>
    <l>Fixed and intent upon its fervid fervour,</l>
    <l>His own with such affection turned to her</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That it made mine more ardent to behold.</l>
