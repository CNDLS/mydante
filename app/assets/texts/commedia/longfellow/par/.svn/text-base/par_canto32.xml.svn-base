  <p>
    <l>Absorbed in his delight, that contemplator</l>
    <l>Assumed the willing office of a teacher,</l>
    <l>And gave beginning to these holy words:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;The wound that Mary closed up and anointed,</l>
    <l>She at her feet who is so beautiful,</l>
    <l>She is the one who opened it and pierced it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within that order which the third seats make</l>
    <l>Is seated Rachel, lower than the other,</l>
    <l>With Beatrice, in manner as thou seest.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and her who was</l>
    <l>Ancestress of the Singer, who for dole</l>
    <l>Of the misdeed said, 'Miserere mei,'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Canst thou behold from seat to seat descending</l>
    <l>Down in gradation, as with each one's name</l>
    <l>I through the Rose go down from leaf to leaf.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And downward from the seventh row, even as</l>
    <l>Above the same, succeed the Hebrew women,</l>
    <l>Dividing all the tresses of the flower;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because, according to the view which Faith</l>
    <l>In Christ had taken, these are the partition</l>
    <l>By which the sacred stairways are divided.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon this side, where perfect is the flower</l>
    <l>With each one of its petals, seated are</l>
    <l>Those who believed in Christ who was to come.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon the other side, where intersected</l>
    <l>With vacant spaces are the semicircles,</l>
    <l>Are those who looked to Christ already come.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as, upon this side, the glorious seat</l>
    <l>Of the Lady of Heaven, and the other seats</l>
    <l>Below it, such a great division make,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So opposite doth that of the great John,</l>
    <l>Who, ever holy, desert and martyrdom</l>
    <l>Endured, and afterwards two years in Hell.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And under him thus to divide were chosen</l>
    <l>Francis, and Benedict, and Augustine,</l>
    <l>And down to us the rest from round to round.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Behold now the high providence divine;</l>
    <l>For one and other aspect of the Faith</l>
    <l>In equal measure shall this garden fill.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And know that downward from that rank which cleaves</l>
    <l>Midway the sequence of the two divisions,</l>
    <l>Not by their proper merit are they seated;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But by another's under fixed conditions;</l>
    <l>For these are spirits one and all assoiled</l>
    <l>Before they any true election had.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Well canst thou recognise it in their faces,</l>
    <l>And also in their voices puerile,</l>
    <l>If thou regard them well and hearken to them.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now doubtest thou, and doubting thou art silent;</l>
    <l>But I will loosen for thee the strong bond</l>
    <l>In which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within the amplitude of this domain</l>
    <l>No casual point can possibly find place,</l>
    <l>No more than sadness can, or thirst, or hunger;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For by eternal law has been established</l>
    <l>Whatever thou beholdest, so that closely</l>
    <l>The ring is fitted to the finger here.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And therefore are these people, festinate</l>
    <l>Unto true life, not 'sine causa' here</l>
    <l>More and less excellent among themselves.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The King, by means of whom this realm reposes</l>
    <l>In so great love and in so great delight</l>
    <l>That no will ventureth to ask for more,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In his own joyous aspect every mind</l>
    <l>Creating, at his pleasure dowers with grace</l>
    <l>Diversely; and let here the effect suffice.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And this is clearly and expressly noted</l>
    <l>For you in Holy Scripture, in those twins</l>
    <l>Who in their mother had their anger roused.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>According to the colour of the hair,</l>
    <l>Therefore, with such a grace the light supreme</l>
    <l>Consenteth that they worthily be crowned.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Without, then, any merit of their deeds,</l>
    <l>Stationed are they in different gradations,</l>
    <l>Differing only in their first acuteness.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'Tis true that in the early centuries,</l>
    <l>With innocence, to work out their salvation</l>
    <l>Sufficient was the faith of parents only.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After the earlier ages were completed,</l>
    <l>Behoved it that the males by circumcision</l>
    <l>Unto their innocent wings should virtue add;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But after that the time of grace had come</l>
    <l>Without the baptism absolute of Christ,</l>
    <l>Such innocence below there was retained.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Look now into the face that unto Christ</l>
    <l>Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only</l>
    <l>Is able to prepare thee to see Christ.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On her did I behold so great a gladness</l>
    <l>Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds</l>
    <l>Created through that altitude to fly,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That whatsoever I had seen before</l>
    <l>Did not suspend me in such admiration,</l>
    <l>Nor show me such similitude of God.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the same Love that first descended there,</l>
    <l>&quot;Ave Maria, gratia plena,&quot; singing,</l>
    <l>In front of her his wings expanded wide.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Unto the canticle divine responded</l>
    <l>From every part the court beatified,</l>
    <l>So that each sight became serener for it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O holy father, who for me endurest</l>
    <l>To be below here, leaving the sweet place</l>
    <l>In which thou sittest by eternal lot,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Who is the Angel that with so much joy</l>
    <l>Into the eyes is looking of our Queen,</l>
    <l>Enamoured so that he seems made of fire?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus I again recourse had to the teaching</l>
    <l>Of that one who delighted him in Mary</l>
    <l>As doth the star of morning in the sun.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;Such gallantry and grace</l>
    <l>As there can be in Angel and in soul,</l>
    <l>All is in him; and thus we fain would have it;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because he is the one who bore the palm</l>
    <l>Down unto Mary, when the Son of God</l>
    <l>To take our burden on himself decreed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But now come onward with thine eyes, as I</l>
    <l>Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians</l>
    <l>Of this most just and merciful of empires.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Those two that sit above there most enrapture</l>
    <l>As being very near unto Augusta,</l>
    <l>Are as it were the two roots of this Rose.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He who upon the left is near her placed</l>
    <l>The father is, by whose audacious taste</l>
    <l>The human species so much bitter tastes.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon the right thou seest that ancient father</l>
    <l>Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ</l>
    <l>The keys committed of this lovely flower.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he who all the evil days beheld,</l>
    <l>Before his death, of her the beauteous bride</l>
    <l>Who with the spear and with the nails was won,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Beside him sits, and by the other rests</l>
    <l>That leader under whom on manna lived</l>
    <l>The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Opposite Peter seest thou Anna seated,</l>
    <l>So well content to look upon her daughter,</l>
    <l>Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And opposite the eldest household father</l>
    <l>Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved</l>
    <l>When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But since the moments of thy vision fly,</l>
    <l>Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor</l>
    <l>Who makes the gown according to his cloth,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And unto the first Love will turn our eyes,</l>
    <l>That looking upon Him thou penetrate</l>
    <l>As far as possible through his effulgence.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Truly, lest peradventure thou recede,</l>
    <l>Moving thy wings believing to advance,</l>
    <l>By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee;</l>
    <l>And thou shalt follow me with thy affection</l>
    <l>That from my words thy heart turn not aside.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he began this holy orison.</l>
