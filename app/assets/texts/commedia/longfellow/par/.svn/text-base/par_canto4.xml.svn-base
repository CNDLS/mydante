    <l>Between two viands, equally removed</l>
    <l>And tempting, a free man would die of hunger</l>
    <l>Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So would a lamb between the ravenings</l>
    <l>Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike;</l>
    <l>And so would stand a dog between two does.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence, if I held my peace, myself I blame not,</l>
    <l>Impelled in equal measure by my doubts,</l>
    <l>Since it must be so, nor do I commend.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I held my peace; but my desire was painted</l>
    <l>Upon my face, and questioning with that</l>
    <l>More fervent far than by articulate speech.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Beatrice did as Daniel had done</l>
    <l>Relieving Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath</l>
    <l>Which rendered him unjustly merciless,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And said: &quot;Well see I how attracteth thee</l>
    <l>One and the other wish, so that thy care</l>
    <l>Binds itself so that forth it does not breathe.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou arguest, if good will be permanent,</l>
    <l>The violence of others, for what reason</l>
    <l>Doth it decrease the measure of my merit?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Again for doubting furnish thee occasion</l>
    <l>Souls seeming to return unto the stars,</l>
    <l>According to the sentiment of Plato.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>These are the questions which upon thy wish</l>
    <l>Are thrusting equally; and therefore first</l>
    <l>Will I treat that which hath the most of gall.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He of the Seraphim most absorbed in God,</l>
    <l>Moses, and Samuel, and whichever John</l>
    <l>Thou mayst select, I say, and even Mary,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Have not in any other heaven their seats,</l>
    <l>Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee,</l>
    <l>Nor of existence more or fewer years;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But all make beautiful the primal circle,</l>
    <l>And have sweet life in different degrees,</l>
    <l>By feeling more or less the eternal breath.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>They showed themselves here, not because allotted</l>
    <l>This sphere has been to them, but to give sign</l>
    <l>Of the celestial which is least exalted.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To speak thus is adapted to your mind,</l>
    <l>Since only through the sense it apprehendeth</l>
    <l>What then it worthy makes of intellect.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On this account the Scripture condescends</l>
    <l>Unto your faculties, and feet and hands</l>
    <l>To God attributes, and means something else;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And Holy Church under an aspect human</l>
    <l>Gabriel and Michael represent to you,</l>
    <l>And him who made Tobias whole again.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That which Timaeus argues of the soul</l>
    <l>Doth not resemble that which here is seen,</l>
    <l>Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He says the soul unto its star returns,</l>
    <l>Believing it to have been severed thence</l>
    <l>Whenever nature gave it as a form.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise</l>
    <l>Than the words sound, and possibly may be</l>
    <l>With meaning that is not to be derided.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If he doth mean that to these wheels return</l>
    <l>The honour of their influence and the blame,</l>
    <l>Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This principle ill understood once warped</l>
    <l>The whole world nearly, till it went astray</l>
    <l>Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The other doubt which doth disquiet thee</l>
    <l>Less venom has, for its malevolence</l>
    <l>Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That as unjust our justice should appear</l>
    <l>In eyes of mortals, is an argument</l>
    <l>Of faith, and not of sin heretical.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But still, that your perception may be able</l>
    <l>To thoroughly penetrate this verity,</l>
    <l>As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If it be violence when he who suffers</l>
    <l>Co-operates not with him who uses force,</l>
    <l>These souls were not on that account excused;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For will is never quenched unless it will,</l>
    <l>But operates as nature doth in fire</l>
    <l>If violence a thousand times distort it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds</l>
    <l>The force; and these have done so, having power</l>
    <l>Of turning back unto the holy place.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If their will had been perfect, like to that</l>
    <l>Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,</l>
    <l>And Mutius made severe to his own hand,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It would have urged them back along the road</l>
    <l>Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;</l>
    <l>But such a solid will is all too rare.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And by these words, if thou hast gathered them</l>
    <l>As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted</l>
    <l>That would have still annoyed thee many times.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But now another passage runs across</l>
    <l>Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself</l>
    <l>Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I have for certain put into thy mind</l>
    <l>That soul beatified could never lie,</l>
    <l>For it is near the primal Truth,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And then thou from Piccarda might'st have heard</l>
    <l>Costanza kept affection for the veil,</l>
    <l>So that she seemeth here to contradict me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Many times, brother, has it come to pass,</l>
    <l>That, to escape from peril, with reluctance</l>
    <l>That has been done it was not right to do,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>E'en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father</l>
    <l>Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)</l>
    <l>Not to lose pity pitiless became.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>At this point I desire thee to remember</l>
    <l>That force with will commingles, and they cause</l>
    <l>That the offences cannot be excused.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Will absolute consenteth not to evil;</l>
    <l>But in so far consenteth as it fears,</l>
    <l>If it refrain, to fall into more harm.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,</l>
    <l>She meaneth the will absolute, and I</l>
    <l>The other, so that both of us speak truth.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such was the flowing of the holy river</l>
    <l>That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;</l>
    <l>This put to rest my wishes one and all.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O love of the first lover, O divine,&quot;</l>
    <l>Said I forthwith, &quot;whose speech inundates me</l>
    <l>And warms me so, it more and more revives me,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My own affection is not so profound</l>
    <l>As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;</l>
    <l>Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Well I perceive that never sated is</l>
    <l>Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,</l>
    <l>Beyond which nothing true expands itself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,</l>
    <l>When it attains it; and it can attain it;</l>
    <l>If not, then each desire would frustrate be.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,</l>
    <l>Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,</l>
    <l>Which to the top from height to height impels us.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This doth invite me, this assurance give me</l>
    <l>With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you</l>
    <l>Another truth, which is obscure to me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I wish to know if man can satisfy you</l>
    <l>For broken vows with other good deeds, so</l>
    <l>That in your balance they will not be light.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes</l>
    <l>Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,</l>
    <l>That, overcome my power, I turned my back</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And almost lost myself with eyes downcast.</l>
