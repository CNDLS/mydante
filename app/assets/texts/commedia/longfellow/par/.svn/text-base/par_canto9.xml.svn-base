  <p>
    <l>Beautiful Clemence, after that thy Charles</l>
    <l>Had me enlightened, he narrated to me</l>
    <l>The treacheries his seed should undergo;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But said: &quot;Be still and let the years roll round;&quot;</l>
    <l>So I can only say, that lamentation</l>
    <l>Legitimate shall follow on your wrongs.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And of that holy light the life already</l>
    <l>Had to the Sun which fills it turned again,</l>
    <l>As to that good which for each thing sufficeth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ah, souls deceived, and creatures impious,</l>
    <l>Who from such good do turn away your hearts,</l>
    <l>Directing upon vanity your foreheads!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And now, behold, another of those splendours</l>
    <l>Approached me, and its will to pleasure me</l>
    <l>It signified by brightening outwardly.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The eyes of Beatrice, that fastened were</l>
    <l>Upon me, as before, of dear assent</l>
    <l>To my desire assurance gave to me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Ah, bring swift compensation to my wish,</l>
    <l>Thou blessed spirit,&quot; I said, &quot;and give me proof</l>
    <l>That what I think in thee I can reflect!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whereat the light, that still was new to me,</l>
    <l>Out of its depths, whence it before was singing,</l>
    <l>As one delighted to do good, continued:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Within that region of the land depraved</l>
    <l>Of Italy, that lies between Rialto</l>
    <l>And fountain-heads of Brenta and of Piava,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Rises a hill, and mounts not very high,</l>
    <l>Wherefrom descended formerly a torch</l>
    <l>That made upon that region great assault.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Out of one root were born both I and it;</l>
    <l>Cunizza was I called, and here I shine</l>
    <l>Because the splendour of this star o'ercame me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But gladly to myself the cause I pardon</l>
    <l>Of my allotment, and it does not grieve me;</l>
    <l>Which would perhaps seem strong unto your vulgar.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of this so luculent and precious jewel,</l>
    <l>Which of our heaven is nearest unto me,</l>
    <l>Great fame remained; and ere it die away</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This hundredth year shall yet quintupled be.</l>
    <l>See if man ought to make him excellent,</l>
    <l>So that another life the first may leave!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And thus thinks not the present multitude</l>
    <l>Shut in by Adige and Tagliamento,</l>
    <l>Nor yet for being scourged is penitent.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But soon 'twill be that Padua in the marsh</l>
    <l>Will change the water that Vicenza bathes,</l>
    <l>Because the folk are stubborn against duty;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And where the Sile and Cagnano join</l>
    <l>One lordeth it, and goes with lofty head,</l>
    <l>For catching whom e'en now the net is making.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Feltro moreover of her impious pastor</l>
    <l>Shall weep the crime, which shall so monstrous be</l>
    <l>That for the like none ever entered Malta.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ample exceedingly would be the vat</l>
    <l>That of the Ferrarese could hold the blood,</l>
    <l>And weary who should weigh it ounce by ounce,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of which this courteous priest shall make a gift</l>
    <l>To show himself a partisan; and such gifts</l>
    <l>Will to the living of the land conform.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Above us there are mirrors, Thrones you call them,</l>
    <l>From which shines out on us God Judicant,</l>
    <l>So that this utterance seems good to us.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Here it was silent, and it had the semblance</l>
    <l>Of being turned elsewhither, by the wheel</l>
    <l>On which it entered as it was before.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The other joy, already known to me,</l>
    <l>Became a thing transplendent in my sight,</l>
    <l>As a fine ruby smitten by the sun.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Through joy effulgence is acquired above,</l>
    <l>As here a smile; but down below, the shade</l>
    <l>Outwardly darkens, as the mind is sad.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;God seeth all things, and in Him, blest spirit,</l>
    <l>Thy sight is,&quot; said I, &quot;so that never will</l>
    <l>Of his can possibly from thee be hidden;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thy voice, then, that for ever makes the heavens</l>
    <l>Glad, with the singing of those holy fires</l>
    <l>Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Wherefore does it not satisfy my longings?</l>
    <l>Indeed, I would not wait thy questioning</l>
    <l>If I in thee were as thou art in me.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;The greatest of the valleys where the water</l>
    <l>Expands itself,&quot; forthwith its words began,</l>
    <l>&quot;That sea excepted which the earth engarlands,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Between discordant shores against the sun</l>
    <l>Extends so far, that it meridian makes</l>
    <l>Where it was wont before to make the horizon.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I was a dweller on that valley's shore</l>
    <l>'Twixt Ebro and Magra that with journey short</l>
    <l>Doth from the Tuscan part the Genoese.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With the same sunset and same sunrise nearly</l>
    <l>Sit Buggia and the city whence I was,</l>
    <l>That with its blood once made the harbour hot.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Folco that people called me unto whom</l>
    <l>My name was known; and now with me this heaven</l>
    <l>Imprints itself, as I did once with it;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For more the daughter of Belus never burned,</l>
    <l>Offending both Sichaeus and Creusa,</l>
    <l>Than I, so long as it became my locks,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor yet that Rodophean, who deluded</l>
    <l>was by Demophoon, nor yet Alcides,</l>
    <l>When Iole he in his heart had locked.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Yet here is no repenting, but we smile,</l>
    <l>Not at the fault, which comes not back to mind,</l>
    <l>But at the power which ordered and foresaw.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Here we behold the art that doth adorn</l>
    <l>With such affection, and the good discover</l>
    <l>Whereby the world above turns that below.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But that thou wholly satisfied mayst bear</l>
    <l>Thy wishes hence which in this sphere are born,</l>
    <l>Still farther to proceed behoveth me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou fain wouldst know who is within this light</l>
    <l>That here beside me thus is scintillating,</l>
    <l>Even as a sunbeam in the limpid water.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then know thou, that within there is at rest</l>
    <l>Rahab, and being to our order joined,</l>
    <l>With her in its supremest grade 'tis sealed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Into this heaven, where ends the shadowy cone</l>
    <l>Cast by your world, before all other souls</l>
    <l>First of Christ's triumph was she taken up.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Full meet it was to leave her in some heaven,</l>
    <l>Even as a palm of the high victory</l>
    <l>Which he acquired with one palm and the other,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because she favoured the first glorious deed</l>
    <l>Of Joshua upon the Holy Land,</l>
    <l>That little stirs the memory of the Pope.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thy city, which an offshoot is of him</l>
    <l>Who first upon his Maker turned his back,</l>
    <l>And whose ambition is so sorely wept,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Brings forth and scatters the accursed flower</l>
    <l>Which both the sheep and lambs hath led astray</l>
    <l>Since it has turned the shepherd to a wolf.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For this the Evangel and the mighty Doctors</l>
    <l>Are derelict, and only the Decretals</l>
    <l>So studied that it shows upon their margins.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On this are Pope and Cardinals intent;</l>
    <l>Their meditations reach not Nazareth,</l>
    <l>There where his pinions Gabriel unfolded;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But Vatican and the other parts elect</l>
    <l>Of Rome, which have a cemetery been</l>
    <l>Unto the soldiery that followed Peter</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Shall soon be free from this adultery.&quot;</l>
