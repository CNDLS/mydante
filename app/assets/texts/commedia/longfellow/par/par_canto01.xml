    <l>The glory of Him who moveth everything</l>
    <l>Doth penetrate the universe, and shine</l>
    <l>In one part more and in another less.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within that heaven which most his light receives</l>
    <l>Was I, and things beheld which to repeat</l>
    <l>Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because in drawing near to its desire</l>
    <l>Our intellect ingulphs itself so far,</l>
    <l>That after it the memory cannot go.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Truly whatever of the holy realm</l>
    <l>I had the power to treasure in my mind</l>
    <l>Shall now become the subject of my song.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O good Apollo, for this last emprise</l>
    <l>Make of me such a vessel of thy power</l>
    <l>As giving the beloved laurel asks!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One summit of Parnassus hitherto</l>
    <l>Has been enough for me, but now with both</l>
    <l>I needs must enter the arena left.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Enter into my bosom, thou, and breathe</l>
    <l>As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw</l>
    <l>Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O power divine, lend'st thou thyself to me</l>
    <l>So that the shadow of the blessed realm</l>
    <l>Stamped in my brain I can make manifest,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou'lt see me come unto thy darling tree,</l>
    <l>And crown myself thereafter with those leaves</l>
    <l>Of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So seldom, Father, do we gather them</l>
    <l>For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet,</l>
    <l>(The fault and shame of human inclinations,)</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That the Peneian foliage should bring forth</l>
    <l>Joy to the joyous Delphic deity,</l>
    <l>When any one it makes to thirst for it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A little spark is followed by great flame;</l>
    <l>Perchance with better voices after me</l>
    <l>Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To mortal men by passages diverse</l>
    <l>Uprises the world's lamp; but by that one</l>
    <l>Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With better course and with a better star</l>
    <l>Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax</l>
    <l>Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Almost that passage had made morning there</l>
    <l>And evening here, and there was wholly white</l>
    <l>That hemisphere, and black the other part,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When Beatrice towards the left-hand side</l>
    <l>I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;</l>
    <l>Never did eagle fasten so upon it!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And even as a second ray is wont</l>
    <l>To issue from the first and reascend,</l>
    <l>Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus of her action, through the eyes infused</l>
    <l>In my imagination, mine I made,</l>
    <l>And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There much is lawful which is here unlawful</l>
    <l>Unto our powers, by virtue of the place</l>
    <l>Made for the human species as its own.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not long I bore it, nor so little while</l>
    <l>But I beheld it sparkle round about</l>
    <l>Like iron that comes molten from the fire;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And suddenly it seemed that day to day</l>
    <l>Was added, as if He who has the power</l>
    <l>Had with another sun the heaven adorned.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With eyes upon the everlasting wheels</l>
    <l>Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her</l>
    <l>Fixing my vision from above removed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such at her aspect inwardly became</l>
    <l>As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him</l>
    <l>Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To represent transhumanise in words</l>
    <l>Impossible were; the example, then, suffice</l>
    <l>Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If I was merely what of me thou newly</l>
    <l>Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,</l>
    <l>Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal</l>
    <l>Desiring thee, made me attentive to it</l>
    <l>By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled</l>
    <l>By the sun's flame, that neither rain nor river</l>
    <l>E'er made a lake so widely spread abroad.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The newness of the sound and the great light</l>
    <l>Kindled in me a longing for their cause,</l>
    <l>Never before with such acuteness felt;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence she, who saw me as I saw myself,</l>
    <l>To quiet in me my perturbed mind,</l>
    <l>Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And she began: &quot;Thou makest thyself so dull</l>
    <l>With false imagining, that thou seest not</l>
    <l>What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou art not upon earth, as thou believest;</l>
    <l>But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,</l>
    <l>Ne'er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If of my former doubt I was divested</l>
    <l>By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,</l>
    <l>I in a new one was the more ensnared;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And said: &quot;Already did I rest content</l>
    <l>From great amazement; but am now amazed</l>
    <l>In what way I transcend these bodies light.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,</l>
    <l>Her eyes directed tow'rds me with that look</l>
    <l>A mother casts on a delirious child;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And she began: &quot;All things whate'er they be</l>
    <l>Have order among themselves, and this is form,</l>
    <l>That makes the universe resemble God.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Here do the higher creatures see the footprints</l>
    <l>Of the Eternal Power, which is the end</l>
    <l>Whereto is made the law already mentioned.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In the order that I speak of are inclined</l>
    <l>All natures, by their destinies diverse,</l>
    <l>More or less near unto their origin;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence they move onward unto ports diverse</l>
    <l>O'er the great sea of being; and each one</l>
    <l>With instinct given it which bears it on.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This bears away the fire towards the moon;</l>
    <l>This is in mortal hearts the motive power</l>
    <l>This binds together and unites the earth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor only the created things that are</l>
    <l>Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,</l>
    <l>But those that have both intellect and love.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Providence that regulates all this</l>
    <l>Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,</l>
    <l>Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And thither now, as to a site decreed,</l>
    <l>Bears us away the virtue of that cord</l>
    <l>Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>True is it, that as oftentimes the form</l>
    <l>Accords not with the intention of the art,</l>
    <l>Because in answering is matter deaf,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So likewise from this course doth deviate</l>
    <l>Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,</l>
    <l>Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>(In the same wise as one may see the fire</l>
    <l>Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus</l>
    <l>Earthward is wrested by some false delight.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,</l>
    <l>At thine ascent, than at a rivulet</l>
    <l>From some high mount descending to the lowland.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Marvel it would be in thee, if deprived</l>
    <l>Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,</l>
    <l>As if on earth the living fire were quiet.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereat she heavenward turned again her face.</l>
