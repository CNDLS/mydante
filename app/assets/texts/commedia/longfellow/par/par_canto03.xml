  <p>
    <l>That Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed,</l>
    <l>Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,</l>
    <l>By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And, that I might confess myself convinced</l>
    <l>And confident, so far as was befitting,</l>
    <l>I lifted more erect my head to speak.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But there appeared a vision, which withdrew me</l>
    <l>So close to it, in order to be seen,</l>
    <l>That my confession I remembered not.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such as through polished and transparent glass,</l>
    <l>Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,</l>
    <l>But not so deep as that their bed be lost,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Come back again the outlines of our faces</l>
    <l>So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white</l>
    <l>Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such saw I many faces prompt to speak,</l>
    <l>So that I ran in error opposite</l>
    <l>To that which kindled love 'twixt man and fountain.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As soon as I became aware of them,</l>
    <l>Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,</l>
    <l>To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And nothing saw, and once more turned them forward</l>
    <l>Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,</l>
    <l>Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Marvel thou not,&quot; she said to me, &quot;because</l>
    <l>I smile at this thy puerile conceit,</l>
    <l>Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But turns thee, as 'tis wont, on emptiness.</l>
    <l>True substances are these which thou beholdest,</l>
    <l>Here relegate for breaking of some vow.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore speak with them, listen and believe;</l>
    <l>For the true light, which giveth peace to them,</l>
    <l>Permits them not to turn from it their feet.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I unto the shade that seemed most wishful</l>
    <l>To speak directed me, and I began,</l>
    <l>As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O well-created spirit, who in the rays</l>
    <l>Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste</l>
    <l>Which being untasted ne'er is comprehended,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Grateful 'twill be to me, if thou content me</l>
    <l>Both with thy name and with your destiny.&quot;</l>
    <l>Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Our charity doth never shut the doors</l>
    <l>Against a just desire, except as one</l>
    <l>Who wills that all her court be like herself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I was a virgin sister in the world;</l>
    <l>And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,</l>
    <l>The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,</l>
    <l>Who, stationed here among these other blessed,</l>
    <l>Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>All our affections, that alone inflamed</l>
    <l>Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,</l>
    <l>Rejoice at being of his order formed;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And this allotment, which appears so low,</l>
    <l>Therefore is given us, because our vows</l>
    <l>Have been neglected and in some part void.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence I to her: &quot;In your miraculous aspects</l>
    <l>There shines I know not what of the divine,</l>
    <l>Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore I was not swift in my remembrance;</l>
    <l>But what thou tellest me now aids me so,</l>
    <l>That the refiguring is easier to me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But tell me, ye who in this place are happy,</l>
    <l>Are you desirous of a higher place,</l>
    <l>To see more or to make yourselves more friends?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>First with those other shades she smiled a little;</l>
    <l>Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,</l>
    <l>She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Brother, our will is quieted by virtue</l>
    <l>Of charity, that makes us wish alone</l>
    <l>For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If to be more exalted we aspired,</l>
    <l>Discordant would our aspirations be</l>
    <l>Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,</l>
    <l>If being in charity is needful here,</l>
    <l>And if thou lookest well into its nature;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nay, 'tis essential to this blest existence</l>
    <l>To keep itself within the will divine,</l>
    <l>Whereby our very wishes are made one;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So that, as we are station above station</l>
    <l>Throughout this realm, to all the realm 'tis pleasing,</l>
    <l>As to the King, who makes his will our will.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And his will is our peace; this is the sea</l>
    <l>To which is moving onward whatsoever</l>
    <l>It doth create, and all that nature makes.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then it was clear to me how everywhere</l>
    <l>In heaven is Paradise, although the grace</l>
    <l>Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But as it comes to pass, if one food sates,</l>
    <l>And for another still remains the longing,</l>
    <l>We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>E'en thus did I; with gesture and with word,</l>
    <l>To learn from her what was the web wherein</l>
    <l>She did not ply the shuttle to the end.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;A perfect life and merit high in-heaven</l>
    <l>A lady o'er us,&quot; said she, &quot;by whose rule</l>
    <l>Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That until death they may both watch and sleep</l>
    <l>Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts</l>
    <l>Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To follow her, in girlhood from the world</l>
    <l>I fled, and in her habit shut myself,</l>
    <l>And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then men accustomed unto evil more</l>
    <l>Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;</l>
    <l>God knows what afterward my life became.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This other splendour, which to thee reveals</l>
    <l>Itself on my right side, and is enkindled</l>
    <l>With all the illumination of our sphere,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>What of myself I say applies to her;</l>
    <l>A nun was she, and likewise from her head</l>
    <l>Was ta'en the shadow of the sacred wimple.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But when she too was to the world returned</l>
    <l>Against her wishes and against good usage,</l>
    <l>Of the heart's veil she never was divested.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of great Costanza this is the effulgence,</l>
    <l>Who from the second wind of Suabia</l>
    <l>Brought forth the third and latest puissance.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus unto me she spake, and then began</l>
    <l>&quot;Ave Maria&quot; singing, and in singing</l>
    <l>Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My sight, that followed her as long a time</l>
    <l>As it was possible, when it had lost her</l>
    <l>Turned round unto the mark of more desire,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And wholly unto Beatrice reverted;</l>
    <l>But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,</l>
    <l>That at the first my sight endured it not;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And this in questioning more backward made me.</l>
