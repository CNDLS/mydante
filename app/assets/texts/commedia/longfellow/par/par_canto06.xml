    <l>&quot;After that Constantine the eagle turned</l>
    <l>Against the course of heaven, which it had followed</l>
    <l>Behind the ancient who Lavinia took,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Two hundred years and more the bird of God</l>
    <l>In the extreme of Europe held itself,</l>
    <l>Near to the mountains whence it issued first;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And under shadow of the sacred plumes</l>
    <l>It governed there the world from hand to hand,</l>
    <l>And, changing thus, upon mine own alighted.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Caesar I was, and am Justinian,</l>
    <l>Who, by the will of primal Love I feel,</l>
    <l>Took from the laws the useless and redundant;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And ere unto the work I was attent,</l>
    <l>One nature to exist in Christ, not more,</l>
    <l>Believed, and with such faith was I contented.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But blessed Agapetus, he who was</l>
    <l>The supreme pastor, to the faith sincere</l>
    <l>Pointed me out the way by words of his.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Him I believed, and what was his assertion</l>
    <l>I now see clearly, even as thou seest</l>
    <l>Each contradiction to be false and true.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As soon as with the Church I moved my feet,</l>
    <l>God in his grace it pleased with this high task</l>
    <l>To inspire me, and I gave me wholly to it,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And to my Belisarius I commended</l>
    <l>The arms, to which was heaven's right hand so joined</l>
    <l>It was a signal that I should repose.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now here to the first question terminates</l>
    <l>My answer; but the character thereof</l>
    <l>Constrains me to continue with a sequel,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In order that thou see with how great reason</l>
    <l>Men move against the standard sacrosanct,</l>
    <l>Both who appropriate and who oppose it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Behold how great a power has made it worthy</l>
    <l>Of reverence, beginning from the hour</l>
    <l>When Pallas died to give it sovereignty.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou knowest it made in Alba its abode</l>
    <l>Three hundred years and upward, till at last</l>
    <l>The three to three fought for it yet again.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong</l>
    <l>Down to Lucretia's sorrow, in seven kings</l>
    <l>O'ercoming round about the neighboring nations;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou knowest what it achieved, borne by the Romans</l>
    <l>Illustrious against Brennus, against Pyrrhus,</l>
    <l>Against the other princes and confederates.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Torquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks</l>
    <l>Unkempt was named, Decii and Fabii,</l>
    <l>Received the fame I willingly embalm;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It struck to earth the pride of the Arabians,</l>
    <l>Who, following Hannibal, had passed across</l>
    <l>The Alpine ridges, Po, from which thou glidest;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Beneath it triumphed while they yet were young</l>
    <l>Pompey and Scipio, and to the hill</l>
    <l>Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then, near unto the time when heaven had willed</l>
    <l>To bring the whole world to its mood serene,</l>
    <l>Did Caesar by the will of Rome assume it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>What it achieved from Var unto the Rhine,</l>
    <l>Isere beheld and Saone, beheld the Seine,</l>
    <l>And every valley whence the Rhone is filled;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>What it achieved when it had left Ravenna,</l>
    <l>And leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight</l>
    <l>That neither tongue nor pen could follow it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Round towards Spain it wheeled its legions; then</l>
    <l>Towards Durazzo, and Pharsalia smote</l>
    <l>That to the calid Nile was felt the pain.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Antandros and the Simois, whence it started,</l>
    <l>It saw again, and there where Hector lies,</l>
    <l>And ill for Ptolemy then roused itself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From thence it came like lightning upon Juba;</l>
    <l>Then wheeled itself again into your West,</l>
    <l>Where the Pompeian clarion it heard.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From what it wrought with the next standard-bearer</l>
    <l>Brutus and Cassius howl in Hell together,</l>
    <l>And Modena and Perugia dolent were;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Still doth the mournful Cleopatra weep</l>
    <l>Because thereof, who, fleeing from before it,</l>
    <l>Took from the adder sudden and black death.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With him it ran even to the Red Sea shore;</l>
    <l>With him it placed the world in so great peace,</l>
    <l>That unto Janus was his temple closed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But what the standard that has made me speak</l>
    <l>Achieved before, and after should achieve</l>
    <l>Throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Becometh in appearance mean and dim,</l>
    <l>If in the hand of the third Caesar seen</l>
    <l>With eye unclouded and affection pure,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because the living Justice that inspires me</l>
    <l>Granted it, in the hand of him I speak of,</l>
    <l>The glory of doing vengeance for its wrath.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now here attend to what I answer thee;</l>
    <l>Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance</l>
    <l>Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten</l>
    <l>The Holy Church, then underneath its wings</l>
    <l>Did Charlemagne victorious succor her.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now hast thou power to judge of such as those</l>
    <l>Whom I accused above, and of their crimes,</l>
    <l>Which are the cause of all your miseries.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To the public standard one the yellow lilies</l>
    <l>Opposes, the other claims it for a party,</l>
    <l>So that 'tis hard to see which sins the most.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Let, let the Ghibellines ply their handicraft</l>
    <l>Beneath some other standard; for this ever</l>
    <l>Ill follows he who it and justice parts.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And let not this new Charles e'er strike it down,</l>
    <l>He and his Guelfs, but let him fear the talons</l>
    <l>That from a nobler lion stripped the fell.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Already oftentimes the sons have wept</l>
    <l>The father's crime; and let him not believe</l>
    <l>That God will change His scutcheon for the lilies.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This little planet doth adorn itself</l>
    <l>With the good spirits that have active been,</l>
    <l>That fame and honour might come after them;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And whensoever the desires mount thither,</l>
    <l>Thus deviating, must perforce the rays</l>
    <l>Of the true love less vividly mount upward.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But in commensuration of our wages</l>
    <l>With our desert is portion of our joy,</l>
    <l>Because we see them neither less nor greater.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Herein doth living Justice sweeten so</l>
    <l>Affection in us, that for evermore</l>
    <l>It cannot warp to any iniquity.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Voices diverse make up sweet melodies;</l>
    <l>So in this life of ours the seats diverse</l>
    <l>Render sweet harmony among these spheres;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And in the compass of this present pearl</l>
    <l>Shineth the sheen of Romeo, of whom</l>
    <l>The grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But the Provencals who against him wrought,</l>
    <l>They have not laughed, and therefore ill goes he</l>
    <l>Who makes his hurt of the good deeds of others.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Four daughters, and each one of them a queen,</l>
    <l>Had Raymond Berenger, and this for him</l>
    <l>Did Romeo, a poor man and a pilgrim;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And then malicious words incited him</l>
    <l>To summon to a reckoning this just man,</l>
    <l>Who rendered to him seven and five for ten.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then he departed poor and stricken in years,</l>
    <l>And if the world could know the heart he had,</l>
    <l>In begging bit by bit his livelihood,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Though much it laud him, it would laud him more.&quot;</l>
