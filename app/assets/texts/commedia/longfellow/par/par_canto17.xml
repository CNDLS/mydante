    <l>As came to Clymene, to be made certain</l>
    <l>Of that which he had heard against himself,</l>
    <l>He who makes fathers chary still to children,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even such was I, and such was I perceived</l>
    <l>By Beatrice and by the holy light</l>
    <l>That first on my account had changed its place.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore my Lady said to me: &quot;Send forth</l>
    <l>The flame of thy desire, so that it issue</l>
    <l>Imprinted well with the internal stamp;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not that our knowledge may be greater made</l>
    <l>By speech of thine, but to accustom thee</l>
    <l>To tell thy thirst, that we may give thee drink.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O my beloved tree, (that so dost lift thee,</l>
    <l>That even as minds terrestrial perceive</l>
    <l>No triangle containeth two obtuse,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So thou beholdest the contingent things</l>
    <l>Ere in themselves they are, fixing thine eyes</l>
    <l>Upon the point in which all times are present,)</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>While I was with Virgilius conjoined</l>
    <l>Upon the mountain that the souls doth heal,</l>
    <l>And when descending into the dead world,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Were spoken to me of my future life</l>
    <l>Some grievous words; although I feel myself</l>
    <l>In sooth foursquare against the blows of chance.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On this account my wish would be content</l>
    <l>To hear what fortune is approaching me,</l>
    <l>Because foreseen an arrow comes more slowly.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus did I say unto that selfsame light</l>
    <l>That unto me had spoken before; and even</l>
    <l>As Beatrice willed was my own will confessed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not in vague phrase, in which the foolish folk</l>
    <l>Ensnared themselves of old, ere yet was slain</l>
    <l>The Lamb of God who taketh sins away,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But with clear words and unambiguous</l>
    <l>Language responded that paternal love,</l>
    <l>Hid and revealed by its own proper smile:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Contingency, that outside of the volume</l>
    <l>Of your materiality extends not,</l>
    <l>Is all depicted in the eternal aspect.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Necessity however thence it takes not,</l>
    <l>Except as from the eye, in which 'tis mirrored,</l>
    <l>A ship that with the current down descends.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From thence, e'en as there cometh to the ear</l>
    <l>Sweet harmony from an organ, comes in sight</l>
    <l>To me the time that is preparing for thee.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As forth from Athens went Hippolytus,</l>
    <l>By reason of his step-dame false and cruel,</l>
    <l>So thou from Florence must perforce depart.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Already this is willed, and this is sought for;</l>
    <l>And soon it shall be done by him who thinks it,</l>
    <l>Where every day the Christ is bought and sold.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The blame shall follow the offended party</l>
    <l>In outcry as is usual; but the vengeance</l>
    <l>Shall witness to the truth that doth dispense it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou shalt abandon everything beloved</l>
    <l>Most tenderly, and this the arrow is</l>
    <l>Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt</l>
    <l>The bread of others, and how hard a road</l>
    <l>The going down and up another's stairs.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders</l>
    <l>Will be the bad and foolish company</l>
    <l>With which into this valley thou shalt fall;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For all ingrate, all mad and impious</l>
    <l>Will they become against thee; but soon after</l>
    <l>They, and not thou, shall have the forehead scarlet.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of their bestiality their own proceedings</l>
    <l>Shall furnish proof; so 'twill be well for thee</l>
    <l>A party to have made thee by thyself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn</l>
    <l>Shall be the mighty Lombard's courtesy,</l>
    <l>Who on the Ladder bears the holy bird,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Who such benign regard shall have for thee</l>
    <l>That 'twixt you twain, in doing and in asking,</l>
    <l>That shall be first which is with others last.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With him shalt thou see one who at his birth</l>
    <l>Has by this star of strength been so impressed,</l>
    <l>That notable shall his achievements be.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not yet the people are aware of him</l>
    <l>Through his young age, since only nine years yet</l>
    <l>Around about him have these wheels revolved.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But ere the Gascon cheat the noble Henry,</l>
    <l>Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear</l>
    <l>In caring not for silver nor for toil.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So recognized shall his magnificence</l>
    <l>Become hereafter, that his enemies</l>
    <l>Will not have power to keep mute tongues about it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On him rely, and on his benefits;</l>
    <l>By him shall many people be transformed,</l>
    <l>Changing condition rich and mendicant;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And written in thy mind thou hence shalt bear</l>
    <l>Of him, but shalt not say it&quot;--and things said he</l>
    <l>Incredible to those who shall be present.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then added: &quot;Son, these are the commentaries</l>
    <l>On what was said to thee; behold the snares</l>
    <l>That are concealed behind few revolutions;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Yet would I not thy neighbours thou shouldst envy,</l>
    <l>Because thy life into the future reaches</l>
    <l>Beyond the punishment of their perfidies.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When by its silence showed that sainted soul</l>
    <l>That it had finished putting in the woof</l>
    <l>Into that web which I had given it warped,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Began I, even as he who yearneth after,</l>
    <l>Being in doubt, some counsel from a person</l>
    <l>Who seeth, and uprightly wills, and loves:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Well see I, father mine, how spurreth on</l>
    <l>The time towards me such a blow to deal me</l>
    <l>As heaviest is to him who most gives way.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore with foresight it is well I arm me,</l>
    <l>That, if the dearest place be taken from me,</l>
    <l>I may not lose the others by my songs.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Down through the world of infinite bitterness,</l>
    <l>And o'er the mountain, from whose beauteous summit</l>
    <l>The eyes of my own Lady lifted me,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And afterward through heaven from light to light,</l>
    <l>I have learned that which, if I tell again,</l>
    <l>Will be a savour of strong herbs to many.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if I am a timid friend to truth,</l>
    <l>I fear lest I may lose my life with those</l>
    <l>Who will hereafter call this time the olden.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The light in which was smiling my own treasure</l>
    <l>Which there I had discovered, flashed at first</l>
    <l>As in the sunshine doth a golden mirror;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then made reply: &quot;A conscience overcast</l>
    <l>Or with its own or with another's shame,</l>
    <l>Will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But ne'ertheless, all falsehood laid aside,</l>
    <l>Make manifest thy vision utterly,</l>
    <l>And let them scratch wherever is the itch;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For if thine utterance shall offensive be</l>
    <l>At the first taste, a vital nutriment</l>
    <l>'Twill leave thereafter, when it is digested.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This cry of thine shall do as doth the wind,</l>
    <l>Which smiteth most the most exalted summits,</l>
    <l>And that is no slight argument of honour.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore are shown to thee within these wheels,</l>
    <l>Upon the mount and in the dolorous valley,</l>
    <l>Only the souls that unto fame are known;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because the spirit of the hearer rests not,</l>
    <l>Nor doth confirm its faith by an example</l>
    <l>Which has the root of it unknown and hidden,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Or other reason that is not apparent.&quot;</l>
