  <p>
    <l>Appeared before me with its wings outspread</l>
    <l>The beautiful image that in sweet fruition</l>
    <l>Made jubilant the interwoven souls;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Appeared a little ruby each, wherein</l>
    <l>Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled</l>
    <l>That each into mine eyes refracted it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And what it now behoves me to retrace</l>
    <l>Nor voice has e'er reported, nor ink written,</l>
    <l>Nor was by fantasy e'er comprehended;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For speak I saw, and likewise heard, the beak,</l>
    <l>And utter with its voice both 'I' and 'My,'</l>
    <l>When in conception it was 'We' and 'Our.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And it began: &quot;Being just and merciful</l>
    <l>Am I exalted here unto that glory</l>
    <l>Which cannot be exceeded by desire;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And upon earth I left my memory</l>
    <l>Such, that the evil-minded people there</l>
    <l>Commend it, but continue not the story.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So doth a single heat from many embers</l>
    <l>Make itself felt, even as from many loves</l>
    <l>Issued a single sound from out that image.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence I thereafter: &quot;O perpetual flowers</l>
    <l>Of the eternal joy, that only one</l>
    <l>Make me perceive your odours manifold,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Exhaling, break within me the great fast</l>
    <l>Which a long season has in hunger held me,</l>
    <l>Not finding for it any food on earth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Well do I know, that if in heaven its mirror</l>
    <l>Justice Divine another realm doth make,</l>
    <l>Yours apprehends it not through any veil.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>You know how I attentively address me</l>
    <l>To listen; and you know what is the doubt</l>
    <l>That is in me so very old a fast.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as a falcon, issuing from his hood,</l>
    <l>Doth move his head, and with his wings applaud him,</l>
    <l>Showing desire, and making himself fine,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Saw I become that standard, which of lauds</l>
    <l>Was interwoven of the grace divine,</l>
    <l>With such songs as he knows who there rejoices.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then it began: &quot;He who a compass turned</l>
    <l>On the world's outer verge, and who within it</l>
    <l>Devised so much occult and manifest,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Could not the impress of his power so make</l>
    <l>On all the universe, as that his Word</l>
    <l>Should not remain in infinite excess.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And this makes certain that the first proud being,</l>
    <l>Who was the paragon of every creature,</l>
    <l>By not awaiting light fell immature.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And hence appears it, that each minor nature</l>
    <l>Is scant receptacle unto that good</l>
    <l>Which has no end, and by itself is measured.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In consequence our vision, which perforce</l>
    <l>Must be some ray of that intelligence</l>
    <l>With which all things whatever are replete,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Cannot in its own nature be so potent,</l>
    <l>That it shall not its origin discern</l>
    <l>Far beyond that which is apparent to it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore into the justice sempiternal</l>
    <l>The power of vision that your world receives,</l>
    <l>As eye into the ocean, penetrates;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Which, though it see the bottom near the shore,</l>
    <l>Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet</l>
    <l>'Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There is no light but comes from the serene</l>
    <l>That never is o'ercast, nay, it is darkness</l>
    <l>Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Amply to thee is opened now the cavern</l>
    <l>Which has concealed from thee the living justice</l>
    <l>Of which thou mad'st such frequent questioning.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For saidst thou: 'Born a man is on the shore</l>
    <l>Of Indus, and is none who there can speak</l>
    <l>Of Christ, nor who can read, nor who can write;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And all his inclinations and his actions</l>
    <l>Are good, so far as human reason sees,</l>
    <l>Without a sin in life or in discourse:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He dieth unbaptised and without faith;</l>
    <l>Where is this justice that condemneth him?</l>
    <l>Where is his fault, if he do not believe?'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now who art thou, that on the bench wouldst sit</l>
    <l>In judgment at a thousand miles away,</l>
    <l>With the short vision of a single span?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Truly to him who with me subtilizes,</l>
    <l>If so the Scripture were not over you,</l>
    <l>For doubting there were marvellous occasion.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O animals terrene, O stolid minds,</l>
    <l>The primal will, that in itself is good,</l>
    <l>Ne'er from itself, the Good Supreme, has moved.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So much is just as is accordant with it;</l>
    <l>No good created draws it to itself,</l>
    <l>But it, by raying forth, occasions that.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as above her nest goes circling round</l>
    <l>The stork when she has fed her little ones,</l>
    <l>And he who has been fed looks up at her,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So lifted I my brows, and even such</l>
    <l>Became the blessed image, which its wings</l>
    <l>Was moving, by so many counsels urged.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Circling around it sang, and said: &quot;As are</l>
    <l>My notes to thee, who dost not comprehend them,</l>
    <l>Such is the eternal judgment to you mortals.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Those lucent splendours of the Holy Spirit</l>
    <l>Grew quiet then, but still within the standard</l>
    <l>That made the Romans reverend to the world.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It recommenced: &quot;Unto this kingdom never</l>
    <l>Ascended one who had not faith in Christ,</l>
    <l>Before or since he to the tree was nailed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But look thou, many crying are, 'Christ, Christ!'</l>
    <l>Who at the judgment shall be far less near</l>
    <l>To him than some shall be who knew not Christ.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such Christians shall the Ethiop condemn,</l>
    <l>When the two companies shall be divided,</l>
    <l>The one for ever rich, the other poor.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>What to your kings may not the Persians say,</l>
    <l>When they that volume opened shall behold</l>
    <l>In which are written down all their dispraises?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There shall be seen, among the deeds of Albert,</l>
    <l>That which ere long shall set the pen in motion,</l>
    <l>For which the realm of Prague shall be deserted.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There shall be seen the woe that on the Seine</l>
    <l>He brings by falsifying of the coin,</l>
    <l>Who by the blow of a wild boar shall die.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There shall be seen the pride that causes thirst,</l>
    <l>Which makes the Scot and Englishman so mad</l>
    <l>That they within their boundaries cannot rest;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Be seen the luxury and effeminate life</l>
    <l>Of him of Spain, and the Bohemian,</l>
    <l>Who valour never knew and never wished;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Be seen the Cripple of Jerusalem,</l>
    <l>His goodness represented by an I,</l>
    <l>While the reverse an M shall represent;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Be seen the avarice and poltroonery</l>
    <l>Of him who guards the Island of the Fire,</l>
    <l>Wherein Anchises finished his long life;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And to declare how pitiful he is</l>
    <l>Shall be his record in contracted letters</l>
    <l>Which shall make note of much in little space.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And shall appear to each one the foul deeds</l>
    <l>Of uncle and of brother who a nation</l>
    <l>So famous have dishonoured, and two crowns.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he of Portugal and he of Norway</l>
    <l>Shall there be known, and he of Rascia too,</l>
    <l>Who saw in evil hour the coin of Venice.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O happy Hungary, if she let herself</l>
    <l>Be wronged no farther! and Navarre the happy,</l>
    <l>If with the hills that gird her she be armed!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And each one may believe that now, as hansel</l>
    <l>Thereof, do Nicosia and Famagosta</l>
    <l>Lament and rage because of their own beast,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Who from the others' flank departeth not.&quot;</l>
