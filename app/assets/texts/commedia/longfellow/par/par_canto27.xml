  <p>
    <l>&quot;Glory be to the Father, to the Son,</l>
    <l>And Holy Ghost!&quot; all Paradise began,</l>
    <l>So that the melody inebriate made me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>What I beheld seemed unto me a smile</l>
    <l>Of the universe; for my inebriation</l>
    <l>Found entrance through the hearing and the sight.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O joy!  O gladness inexpressible!</l>
    <l>O perfect life of love and peacefulness!</l>
    <l>O riches without hankering secure!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Before mine eyes were standing the four torches</l>
    <l>Enkindled, and the one that first had come</l>
    <l>Began to make itself more luminous;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And even such in semblance it became</l>
    <l>As Jupiter would become, if he and Mars</l>
    <l>Were birds, and they should interchange their feathers.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That Providence, which here distributeth</l>
    <l>Season and service, in the blessed choir</l>
    <l>Had silence upon every side imposed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When I heard say: &quot;If I my colour change,</l>
    <l>Marvel not at it; for while I am speaking</l>
    <l>Thou shalt behold all these their colour change.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He who usurps upon the earth my place,</l>
    <l>My place, my place, which vacant has become</l>
    <l>Before the presence of the Son of God,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Has of my cemetery made a sewer</l>
    <l>Of blood and stench, whereby the Perverse One,</l>
    <l>Who fell from here, below there is appeased!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With the same colour which, through sun adverse,</l>
    <l>Painteth the clouds at evening or at morn,</l>
    <l>Beheld I then the whole of heaven suffused.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as a modest woman, who abides</l>
    <l>Sure of herself, and at another's failing,</l>
    <l>From listening only, timorous becomes,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even thus did Beatrice change countenance;</l>
    <l>And I believe in heaven was such eclipse,</l>
    <l>When suffered the supreme Omnipotence;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereafterward proceeded forth his words</l>
    <l>With voice so much transmuted from itself,</l>
    <l>The very countenance was not more changed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;The spouse of Christ has never nurtured been</l>
    <l>On blood of mine, of Linus and of Cletus,</l>
    <l>To be made use of in acquest of gold;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But in acquest of this delightful life</l>
    <l>Sixtus and Pius, Urban and Calixtus,</l>
    <l>After much lamentation, shed their blood.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Our purpose was not, that on the right hand</l>
    <l>Of our successors should in part be seated</l>
    <l>The Christian folk, in part upon the other;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor that the keys which were to me confided</l>
    <l>Should e'er become the escutcheon on a banner,</l>
    <l>That should wage war on those who are baptized;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor I be made the figure of a seal</l>
    <l>To privileges venal and mendacious,</l>
    <l>Whereat I often redden and flash with fire.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In garb of shepherds the rapacious wolves</l>
    <l>Are seen from here above o'er all the pastures!</l>
    <l>O wrath of God, why dost thou slumber still?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To drink our blood the Caorsines and Gascons</l>
    <l>Are making ready.  O thou good beginning,</l>
    <l>Unto how vile an end must thou needs fall!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But the high Providence, that with Scipio</l>
    <l>At Rome the glory of the world defended,</l>
    <l>Will speedily bring aid, as I conceive;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And thou, my son, who by thy mortal weight</l>
    <l>Shalt down return again, open thy mouth;</l>
    <l>What I conceal not, do not thou conceal.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As with its frozen vapours downward falls</l>
    <l>In flakes our atmosphere, what time the horn</l>
    <l>Of the celestial Goat doth touch the sun,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upward in such array saw I the ether</l>
    <l>Become, and flaked with the triumphant vapours,</l>
    <l>Which there together with us had remained.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My sight was following up their semblances,</l>
    <l>And followed till the medium, by excess,</l>
    <l>The passing farther onward took from it;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whereat the Lady, who beheld me freed</l>
    <l>From gazing upward, said to me: &quot;Cast down</l>
    <l>Thy sight, and see how far thou art turned round.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Since the first time that I had downward looked,</l>
    <l>I saw that I had moved through the whole arc</l>
    <l>Which the first climate makes from midst to end;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So that I saw the mad track of Ulysses</l>
    <l>Past Gades, and this side, well nigh the shore</l>
    <l>Whereon became Europa a sweet burden.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And of this threshing-floor the site to me</l>
    <l>Were more unveiled, but the sun was proceeding</l>
    <l>Under my feet, a sign and more removed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My mind enamoured, which is dallying</l>
    <l>At all times with my Lady, to bring back</l>
    <l>To her mine eyes was more than ever ardent.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if or Art or Nature has made bait</l>
    <l>To catch the eyes and so possess the mind,</l>
    <l>In human flesh or in its portraiture,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>All joined together would appear as nought</l>
    <l>To the divine delight which shone upon me</l>
    <l>When to her smiling face I turned me round.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The virtue that her look endowed me with</l>
    <l>From the fair nest of Leda tore me forth,</l>
    <l>And up into the swiftest heaven impelled me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Its parts exceeding full of life and lofty</l>
    <l>Are all so uniform, I cannot say</l>
    <l>Which Beatrice selected for my place.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But she, who was aware of my desire,</l>
    <l>Began, the while she smiled so joyously</l>
    <l>That God seemed in her countenance to rejoice:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;The nature of that motion, which keeps quiet</l>
    <l>The centre and all the rest about it moves,</l>
    <l>From hence begins as from its starting point.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And in this heaven there is no other Where</l>
    <l>Than in the Mind Divine, wherein is kindled</l>
    <l>The love that turns it, and the power it rains.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within a circle light and love embrace it,</l>
    <l>Even as this doth the others, and that precinct</l>
    <l>He who encircles it alone controls.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Its motion is not by another meted,</l>
    <l>But all the others measured are by this,</l>
    <l>As ten is by the half and by the fifth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And in what manner time in such a pot</l>
    <l>May have its roots, and in the rest its leaves,</l>
    <l>Now unto thee can manifest be made.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O Covetousness, that mortals dost ingulf</l>
    <l>Beneath thee so, that no one hath the power</l>
    <l>Of drawing back his eyes from out thy waves!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Full fairly blossoms in mankind the will;</l>
    <l>But the uninterrupted rain converts</l>
    <l>Into abortive wildings the true plums.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Fidelity and innocence are found</l>
    <l>Only in children; afterwards they both</l>
    <l>Take flight or e'er the cheeks with down are covered.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One, while he prattles still, observes the fasts,</l>
    <l>Who, when his tongue is loosed, forthwith devours</l>
    <l>Whatever food under whatever moon;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Another, while he prattles, loves and listens</l>
    <l>Unto his mother, who when speech is perfect</l>
    <l>Forthwith desires to see her in her grave.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even thus is swarthy made the skin so white</l>
    <l>In its first aspect of the daughter fair</l>
    <l>Of him who brings the morn, and leaves the night.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou, that it may not be a marvel to thee,</l>
    <l>Think that on earth there is no one who governs;</l>
    <l>Whence goes astray the human family.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ere January be unwintered wholly</l>
    <l>By the centesimal on earth neglected,</l>
    <l>Shall these supernal circles roar so loud</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The tempest that has been so long awaited</l>
    <l>Shall whirl the poops about where are the prows;</l>
    <l>So that the fleet shall run its course direct,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the true fruit shall follow on the flower.&quot;</l>
