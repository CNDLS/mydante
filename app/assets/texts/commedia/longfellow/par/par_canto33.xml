  <p>
    <l>&quot;Thou Virgin Mother, daughter of thy Son,</l>
    <l>Humble and high beyond all other creature,</l>
    <l>The limit fixed of the eternal counsel,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou art the one who such nobility</l>
    <l>To human nature gave, that its Creator</l>
    <l>Did not disdain to make himself its creature.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within thy womb rekindled was the love,</l>
    <l>By heat of which in the eternal peace</l>
    <l>After such wise this flower has germinated.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Here unto us thou art a noonday torch</l>
    <l>Of charity, and below there among mortals</l>
    <l>Thou art the living fountain-head of hope.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Lady, thou art so great, and so prevailing,</l>
    <l>That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee,</l>
    <l>His aspirations without wings would fly.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not only thy benignity gives succour</l>
    <l>To him who asketh it, but oftentimes</l>
    <l>Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In thee compassion is, in thee is pity,</l>
    <l>In thee magnificence; in thee unites</l>
    <l>Whate'er of goodness is in any creature.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now doth this man, who from the lowest depth</l>
    <l>Of the universe as far as here has seen</l>
    <l>One after one the spiritual lives,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Supplicate thee through grace for so much power</l>
    <l>That with his eyes he may uplift himself</l>
    <l>Higher towards the uttermost salvation.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I, who never burned for my own seeing</l>
    <l>More than I do for his, all of my prayers</l>
    <l>Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud</l>
    <l>Of his mortality so with thy prayers,</l>
    <l>That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Still farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst</l>
    <l>Whate'er thou wilt, that sound thou mayst preserve</l>
    <l>After so great a vision his affections.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Let thy protection conquer human movements;</l>
    <l>See Beatrice and all the blessed ones</l>
    <l>My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The eyes beloved and revered of God,</l>
    <l>Fastened upon the speaker, showed to us</l>
    <l>How grateful unto her are prayers devout;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then unto the Eternal Light they turned,</l>
    <l>On which it is not credible could be</l>
    <l>By any creature bent an eye so clear.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I, who to the end of all desires</l>
    <l>Was now approaching, even as I ought</l>
    <l>The ardour of desire within me ended.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,</l>
    <l>That I should upward look; but I already</l>
    <l>Was of my own accord such as he wished;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because my sight, becoming purified,</l>
    <l>Was entering more and more into the ray</l>
    <l>Of the High Light which of itself is true.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From that time forward what I saw was greater</l>
    <l>Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,</l>
    <l>And yields the memory unto such excess.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as he is who seeth in a dream,</l>
    <l>And after dreaming the imprinted passion</l>
    <l>Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even such am I, for almost utterly</l>
    <l>Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet</l>
    <l>Within my heart the sweetness born of it;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed,</l>
    <l>Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves</l>
    <l>Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee</l>
    <l>From the conceits of mortals, to my mind</l>
    <l>Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And make my tongue of so great puissance,</l>
    <l>That but a single sparkle of thy glory</l>
    <l>It may bequeath unto the future people;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For by returning to my memory somewhat,</l>
    <l>And by a little sounding in these verses,</l>
    <l>More of thy victory shall be conceived!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I think the keenness of the living ray</l>
    <l>Which I endured would have bewildered me,</l>
    <l>If but mine eyes had been averted from it;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I remember that I was more bold</l>
    <l>On this account to bear, so that I joined</l>
    <l>My aspect with the Glory Infinite.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O grace abundant, by which I presumed</l>
    <l>To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,</l>
    <l>So that the seeing I consumed therein!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw that in its depth far down is lying</l>
    <l>Bound up with love together in one volume,</l>
    <l>What through the universe in leaves is scattered;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Substance, and accident, and their operations,</l>
    <l>All interfused together in such wise</l>
    <l>That what I speak of is one simple light.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The universal fashion of this knot</l>
    <l>Methinks I saw, since more abundantly</l>
    <l>In saying this I feel that I rejoice.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One moment is more lethargy to me,</l>
    <l>Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise</l>
    <l>That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,</l>
    <l>Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,</l>
    <l>And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In presence of that light one such becomes,</l>
    <l>That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect</l>
    <l>It is impossible he e'er consent;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because the good, which object is of will,</l>
    <l>Is gathered all in this, and out of it</l>
    <l>That is defective which is perfect there.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Shorter henceforward will my language fall</l>
    <l>Of what I yet remember, than an infant's</l>
    <l>Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not because more than one unmingled semblance</l>
    <l>Was in the living light on which I looked,</l>
    <l>For it is always what it was before;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But through the sight, that fortified itself</l>
    <l>In me by looking, one appearance only</l>
    <l>To me was ever changing as I changed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within the deep and luminous subsistence</l>
    <l>Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,</l>
    <l>Of threefold colour and of one dimension,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And by the second seemed the first reflected</l>
    <l>As Iris is by Iris, and the third</l>
    <l>Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O how all speech is feeble and falls short</l>
    <l>Of my conceit, and this to what I saw</l>
    <l>Is such, 'tis not enough to call it little!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,</l>
    <l>Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself</l>
    <l>And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That circulation, which being thus conceived</l>
    <l>Appeared in thee as a reflected light,</l>
    <l>When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within itself, of its own very colour</l>
    <l>Seemed to me painted with our effigy,</l>
    <l>Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As the geometrician, who endeavours</l>
    <l>To square the circle, and discovers not,</l>
    <l>By taking thought, the principle he wants,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even such was I at that new apparition;</l>
    <l>I wished to see how the image to the circle</l>
    <l>Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But my own wings were not enough for this,</l>
    <l>Had it not been that then my mind there smote</l>
    <l>A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy:</l>
    <l>But now was turning my desire and will,</l>
    <l>Even as a wheel that equally is moved,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.</l>
