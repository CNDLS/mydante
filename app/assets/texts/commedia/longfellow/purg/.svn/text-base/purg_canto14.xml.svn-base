  <p>
    <l>&quot;Who is this one that goes about our mountain,</l>
    <l>Or ever Death has given him power of flight,</l>
    <l>And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;I know not who, but know he's not alone;</l>
    <l>Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,</l>
    <l>And gently, so that he may speak, accost him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus did two spirits, leaning tow'rds each other,</l>
    <l>Discourse about me there on the right hand;</l>
    <l>Then held supine their faces to address me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And said the one: &quot;O soul, that, fastened still</l>
    <l>Within the body, tow'rds the heaven art going,</l>
    <l>For charity console us, and declare</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence comest and who art thou; for thou mak'st us</l>
    <l>As much to marvel at this grace of thine</l>
    <l>As must a thing that never yet has been.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I: &quot;Through midst of Tuscany there wanders</l>
    <l>A streamlet that is born in Falterona,</l>
    <l>And not a hundred miles of course suffice it;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From thereupon do I this body bring.</l>
    <l>To tell you who I am were speech in vain,</l>
    <l>Because my name as yet makes no great noise.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;If well thy meaning I can penetrate</l>
    <l>With intellect of mine,&quot; then answered me</l>
    <l>He who first spake, &quot;thou speakest of the Arno.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And said the other to him: &quot;Why concealed</l>
    <l>This one the appellation of that river,</l>
    <l>Even as a man doth of things horrible?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And thus the shade that questioned was of this</l>
    <l>Himself acquitted: &quot;I know not; but truly</l>
    <l>'Tis fit the name of such a valley perish;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant</l>
    <l>The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro</l>
    <l>That in few places it that mark surpasses)</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To where it yields itself in restoration</l>
    <l>Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up,</l>
    <l>Whence have the rivers that which goes with them,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Virtue is like an enemy avoided</l>
    <l>By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune</l>
    <l>Of place, or through bad habit that impels them;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On which account have so transformed their nature</l>
    <l>The dwellers in that miserable valley,</l>
    <l>It seems that Circe had them in her pasture.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier</l>
    <l>Than other food for human use created,</l>
    <l>It first directeth its impoverished way.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Curs findeth it thereafter, coming downward,</l>
    <l>More snarling than their puissance demands,</l>
    <l>And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It goes on falling, and the more it grows,</l>
    <l>The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves,</l>
    <l>This maledict and misadventurous ditch.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Descended then through many a hollow gulf,</l>
    <l>It finds the foxes so replete with fraud,</l>
    <l>They fear no cunning that may master them.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor will I cease because another hears me;</l>
    <l>And well 'twill be for him, if still he mind him</l>
    <l>Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thy grandson I behold, who doth become</l>
    <l>A hunter of those wolves upon the bank</l>
    <l>Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He sells their flesh, it being yet alive;</l>
    <l>Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves;</l>
    <l>Many of life, himself of praise, deprives.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Blood-stained he issues from the dismal forest;</l>
    <l>He leaves it such, a thousand years from now</l>
    <l>In its primeval state 'tis not re-wooded.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As at the announcement of impending ills</l>
    <l>The face of him who listens is disturbed,</l>
    <l>From whate'er side the peril seize upon him;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So I beheld that other soul, which stood</l>
    <l>Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad,</l>
    <l>When it had gathered to itself the word.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The speech of one and aspect of the other</l>
    <l>Had me desirous made to know their names,</l>
    <l>And question mixed with prayers I made thereof,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whereat the spirit which first spake to me</l>
    <l>Began again: &quot;Thou wishest I should bring me</l>
    <l>To do for thee what thou'lt not do for me;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But since God willeth that in thee shine forth</l>
    <l>Such grace of his, I'll not be chary with thee;</l>
    <l>Know, then, that I Guido del Duca am.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My blood was so with envy set on fire,</l>
    <l>That if I had beheld a man make merry,</l>
    <l>Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o'er with pallor.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From my own sowing such the straw I reap!</l>
    <l>O human race! why dost thou set thy heart</l>
    <l>Where interdict of partnership must be?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This is Renier; this is the boast and honour</l>
    <l>Of the house of Calboli, where no one since</l>
    <l>Has made himself the heir of his desert.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And not alone his blood is made devoid,</l>
    <l>'Twixt Po and mount, and sea-shore and the Reno,</l>
    <l>Of good required for truth and for diversion;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For all within these boundaries is full</l>
    <l>Of venomous roots, so that too tardily</l>
    <l>By cultivation now would they diminish.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Where is good Lizio, and Arrigo Manardi,</l>
    <l>Pier Traversaro, and Guido di Carpigna,</l>
    <l>O Romagnuoli into bastards turned?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When in Bologna will a Fabbro rise?</l>
    <l>When in Faenza a Bernardin di Fosco,</l>
    <l>The noble scion of ignoble seed?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Be not astonished, Tuscan, if I weep,</l>
    <l>When I remember, with Guido da Prata,</l>
    <l>Ugolin d' Azzo, who was living with us,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Frederick Tignoso and his company,</l>
    <l>The house of Traversara, and th' Anastagi,</l>
    <l>And one race and the other is extinct;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The dames and cavaliers, the toils and ease</l>
    <l>That filled our souls with love and courtesy,</l>
    <l>There where the hearts have so malicious grown!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O Brettinoro! why dost thou not flee,</l>
    <l>Seeing that all thy family is gone,</l>
    <l>And many people, not to be corrupted?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Bagnacaval does well in not begetting</l>
    <l>And ill does Castrocaro, and Conio worse,</l>
    <l>In taking trouble to beget such Counts.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Will do well the Pagani, when their Devil</l>
    <l>Shall have departed; but not therefore pure</l>
    <l>Will testimony of them e'er remain.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O Ugolin de' Fantoli, secure</l>
    <l>Thy name is, since no longer is awaited</l>
    <l>One who, degenerating, can obscure it!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But go now, Tuscan, for it now delights me</l>
    <l>To weep far better than it does to speak,</l>
    <l>So much has our discourse my mind distressed.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We were aware that those beloved souls</l>
    <l>Heard us depart; therefore, by keeping silent,</l>
    <l>They made us of our pathway confident.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When we became alone by going onward,</l>
    <l>Thunder, when it doth cleave the air, appeared</l>
    <l>A voice, that counter to us came, exclaiming:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Shall slay me whosoever findeth me!&quot;</l>
    <l>And fled as the reverberation dies</l>
    <l>If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As soon as hearing had a truce from this,</l>
    <l>Behold another, with so great a crash,</l>
    <l>That it resembled thunderings following fast:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;I am Aglaurus, who became a stone!&quot;</l>
    <l>And then, to press myself close to the Poet,</l>
    <l>I backward, and not forward, took a step.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Already on all sides the air was quiet;</l>
    <l>And said he to me: &quot;That was the hard curb</l>
    <l>That ought to hold a man within his bounds;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But you take in the bait so that the hook</l>
    <l>Of the old Adversary draws you to him,</l>
    <l>And hence availeth little curb or call.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The heavens are calling you, and wheel around you,</l>
    <l>Displaying to you their eternal beauties,</l>
    <l>And still your eye is looking on the ground;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence He, who all discerns, chastises you.&quot;</l>
