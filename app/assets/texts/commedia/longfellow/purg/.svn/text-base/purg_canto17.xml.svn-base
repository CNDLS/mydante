    <l>Remember, Reader, if e'er in the Alps</l>
    <l>A mist o'ertook thee, through which thou couldst see</l>
    <l>Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>How, when the vapours humid and condensed</l>
    <l>Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere</l>
    <l>Of the sun feebly enters in among them,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And thy imagination will be swift</l>
    <l>In coming to perceive how I re-saw</l>
    <l>The sun at first, that was already setting.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master</l>
    <l>Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud</l>
    <l>To rays already dead on the low shores.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O thou, Imagination, that dost steal us</l>
    <l>So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,</l>
    <l>Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Who moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?</l>
    <l>Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,</l>
    <l>By self, or by a will that downward guides it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of her impiety, who changed her form</l>
    <l>Into the bird that most delights in singing,</l>
    <l>In my imagining appeared the trace;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn</l>
    <l>Within itself, that from without there came</l>
    <l>Nothing that then might be received by it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then reigned within my lofty fantasy</l>
    <l>One crucified, disdainful and ferocious</l>
    <l>In countenance, and even thus was dying.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Around him were the great Ahasuerus,</l>
    <l>Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,</l>
    <l>Who was in word and action so entire.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And even as this image burst asunder</l>
    <l>Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble</l>
    <l>In which the water it was made of fails,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There rose up in my vision a young maiden</l>
    <l>Bitterly weeping, and she said: &quot;O queen,</l>
    <l>Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou'st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;</l>
    <l>Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,</l>
    <l>Mother, at thine ere at another's ruin.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden</l>
    <l>New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,</l>
    <l>And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So this imagining of mine fell down</l>
    <l>As soon as the effulgence smote my face,</l>
    <l>Greater by far than what is in our wont.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I turned me round to see where I might be,</l>
    <l>When said a voice, &quot;Here is the passage up;&quot;</l>
    <l>Which from all other purposes removed me,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And made my wish so full of eagerness</l>
    <l>To look and see who was it that was speaking,</l>
    <l>It never rests till meeting face to face;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But as before the sun, which quells the sight,</l>
    <l>And in its own excess its figure veils,</l>
    <l>Even so my power was insufficient here.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;This is a spirit divine, who in the way</l>
    <l>Of going up directs us without asking,</l>
    <l>And who with his own light himself conceals.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He does with us as man doth with himself;</l>
    <l>For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,</l>
    <l>Malignly leans already tow'rds denial.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Accord we now our feet to such inviting,</l>
    <l>Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;</l>
    <l>For then we could not till the day return.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus my Conductor said; and I and he</l>
    <l>Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;</l>
    <l>And I, as soon as the first step I reached,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Near me perceived a motion as of wings,</l>
    <l>And fanning in the face, and saying, &quot;'Beati</l>
    <l>Pacifici,' who are without ill anger.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Already over us were so uplifted</l>
    <l>The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,</l>
    <l>That upon many sides the stars appeared.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?&quot;</l>
    <l>I said within myself; for I perceived</l>
    <l>The vigour of my legs was put in truce.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We at the point were where no more ascends</l>
    <l>The stairway upward, and were motionless,</l>
    <l>Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I gave heed a little, if I might hear</l>
    <l>Aught whatsoever in the circle new;</l>
    <l>Then to my Master turned me round and said:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency</l>
    <l>Is purged here in the circle where we are?</l>
    <l>Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;The love of good, remiss</l>
    <l>In what it should have done, is here restored;</l>
    <l>Here plied again the ill-belated oar;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But still more openly to understand,</l>
    <l>Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather</l>
    <l>Some profitable fruit from our delay.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Neither Creator nor a creature ever,</l>
    <l>Son,&quot; he began, &quot;was destitute of love</l>
    <l>Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The natural was ever without error;</l>
    <l>But err the other may by evil object,</l>
    <l>Or by too much, or by too little vigour.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>While in the first it well directed is,</l>
    <l>And in the second moderates itself,</l>
    <l>It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But when to ill it turns, and, with more care</l>
    <l>Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,</l>
    <l>'Gainst the Creator works his own creation.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be</l>
    <l>The seed within yourselves of every virtue,</l>
    <l>And every act that merits punishment.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now inasmuch as never from the welfare</l>
    <l>Of its own subject can love turn its sight,</l>
    <l>From their own hatred all things are secure;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And since we cannot think of any being</l>
    <l>Standing alone, nor from the First divided,</l>
    <l>Of hating Him is all desire cut off.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,</l>
    <l>The evil that one loves is of one's neighbour,</l>
    <l>And this is born in three modes in your clay.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There are, who, by abasement of their neighbour,</l>
    <l>Hope to excel, and therefore only long</l>
    <l>That from his greatness he may be cast down;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There are, who power, grace, honour, and renown</l>
    <l>Fear they may lose because another rises,</l>
    <l>Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And there are those whom injury seems to chafe,</l>
    <l>So that it makes them greedy for revenge,</l>
    <l>And such must needs shape out another's harm.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This threefold love is wept for down below;</l>
    <l>Now of the other will I have thee hear,</l>
    <l>That runneth after good with measure faulty.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Each one confusedly a good conceives</l>
    <l>Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;</l>
    <l>Therefore to overtake it each one strives.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If languid love to look on this attract you,</l>
    <l>Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,</l>
    <l>After just penitence, torments you for it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There's other good that does not make man happy;</l>
    <l>'Tis not felicity, 'tis not the good</l>
    <l>Essence, of every good the fruit and root.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The love that yields itself too much to this</l>
    <l>Above us is lamented in three circles;</l>
    <l>But how tripartite it may be described,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I say not, that thou seek it for thyself.&quot;</l>
