  <p>
    <l>Already had the sun the horizon reached</l>
    <l>Whose circle of meridian covers o'er</l>
    <l>Jerusalem with its most lofty point,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And night that opposite to him revolves</l>
    <l>Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales</l>
    <l>That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So that the white and the vermilion cheeks</l>
    <l>Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,</l>
    <l>By too great age were changing into orange.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We still were on the border of the sea,</l>
    <l>Like people who are thinking of their road,</l>
    <l>Who go in heart and with the body stay;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,</l>
    <l>Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red</l>
    <l>Down in the West upon the ocean floor,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Appeared to me--may I again behold it!--</l>
    <l>A light along the sea so swiftly coming,</l>
    <l>Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From which when I a little had withdrawn</l>
    <l>Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,</l>
    <l>Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then on each side of it appeared to me</l>
    <l>I knew not what of white, and underneath it</l>
    <l>Little by little there came forth another.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My Master yet had uttered not a word</l>
    <l>While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;</l>
    <l>But when he clearly recognised the pilot,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He cried: &quot;Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!</l>
    <l>Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!</l>
    <l>Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>See how he scorneth human arguments,</l>
    <l>So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail</l>
    <l>Than his own wings, between so distant shores.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,</l>
    <l>Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,</l>
    <l>That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then as still nearer and more near us came</l>
    <l>The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,</l>
    <l>So that near by the eye could not endure him,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But down I cast it; and he came to shore</l>
    <l>With a small vessel, very swift and light,</l>
    <l>So that the water swallowed naught thereof.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;</l>
    <l>Beatitude seemed written in his face,</l>
    <l>And more than a hundred spirits sat within.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;In exitu Israel de Aegypto!&quot;</l>
    <l>They chanted all together in one voice,</l>
    <l>With whatso in that psalm is after written.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,</l>
    <l>Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,</l>
    <l>And he departed swiftly as he came.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The throng which still remained there unfamiliar</l>
    <l>Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,</l>
    <l>As one who in new matters makes essay.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On every side was darting forth the day.</l>
    <l>The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts</l>
    <l>From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When the new people lifted up their faces</l>
    <l>Towards us, saying to us: &quot;If ye know,</l>
    <l>Show us the way to go unto the mountain.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And answer made Virgilius: &quot;Ye believe</l>
    <l>Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,</l>
    <l>But we are strangers even as yourselves.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Just now we came, a little while before you,</l>
    <l>Another way, which was so rough and steep,</l>
    <l>That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,</l>
    <l>Become aware that I was still alive,</l>
    <l>Pallid in their astonishment became;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as to messenger who bears the olive</l>
    <l>The people throng to listen to the news,</l>
    <l>And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So at the sight of me stood motionless</l>
    <l>Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if</l>
    <l>Oblivious to go and make them fair.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One from among them saw I coming forward,</l>
    <l>As to embrace me, with such great affection,</l>
    <l>That it incited me to do the like.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O empty shadows, save in aspect only!</l>
    <l>Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,</l>
    <l>As oft returned with them to my own breast!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I think with wonder I depicted me;</l>
    <l>Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;</l>
    <l>And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Gently it said that I should stay my steps;</l>
    <l>Then knew I who it was, and I entreated</l>
    <l>That it would stop awhile to speak with me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It made reply to me: &quot;Even as I loved thee</l>
    <l>In mortal body, so I love thee free;</l>
    <l>Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;My own Casella! to return once more</l>
    <l>There where I am, I make this journey,&quot; said I;</l>
    <l>&quot;But how from thee has so much time be taken?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;No outrage has been done me,</l>
    <l>If he who takes both when and whom he pleases</l>
    <l>Has many times denied to me this passage,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For of a righteous will his own is made.</l>
    <l>He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken</l>
    <l>Whoever wished to enter with all peace;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore</l>
    <l>Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,</l>
    <l>Benignantly by him have been received.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,</l>
    <l>Because for evermore assemble there</l>
    <l>Those who tow'rds Acheron do not descend.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I: &quot;If some new law take not from thee</l>
    <l>Memory or practice of the song of love,</l>
    <l>Which used to quiet in me all my longings,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thee may it please to comfort therewithal</l>
    <l>Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body</l>
    <l>Hitherward coming is so much distressed.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Love, that within my mind discourses with me,&quot;</l>
    <l>Forthwith began he so melodiously,</l>
    <l>The melody within me still is sounding.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My Master, and myself, and all that people</l>
    <l>Which with him were, appeared as satisfied</l>
    <l>As if naught else might touch the mind of any.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We all of us were moveless and attentive</l>
    <l>Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,</l>
    <l>Exclaiming: &quot;What is this, ye laggard spirits?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>What negligence, what standing still is this?</l>
    <l>Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,</l>
    <l>That lets not God be manifest to you.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as when, collecting grain or tares,</l>
    <l>The doves, together at their pasture met,</l>
    <l>Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If aught appear of which they are afraid,</l>
    <l>Upon a sudden leave their food alone,</l>
    <l>Because they are assailed by greater care;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So that fresh company did I behold</l>
    <l>The song relinquish, and go tow'rds the hill,</l>
    <l>As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor was our own departure less in haste.</l>
