  <p>
    <l>The natural thirst, that ne'er is satisfied</l>
    <l>Excepting with the water for whose grace</l>
    <l>The woman of Samaria besought,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Put me in travail, and haste goaded me</l>
    <l>Along the encumbered path behind my Leader</l>
    <l>And I was pitying that righteous vengeance;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And lo! in the same manner as Luke writeth</l>
    <l>That Christ appeared to two upon the way</l>
    <l>From the sepulchral cave already risen,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A shade appeared to us, and came behind us,</l>
    <l>Down gazing on the prostrate multitude,</l>
    <l>Nor were we ware of it, until it spake,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Saying, &quot;My brothers, may God give you peace!&quot;</l>
    <l>We turned us suddenly, and Virgilius rendered</l>
    <l>To him the countersign thereto conforming.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereon began he: &quot;In the blessed council,</l>
    <l>Thee may the court veracious place in peace,</l>
    <l>That me doth banish in eternal exile!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;How,&quot; said he, and the while we went with speed,</l>
    <l>&quot;If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,</l>
    <l>Who up his stairs so far has guided you?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And said my Teacher: &quot;If thou note the marks</l>
    <l>Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces</l>
    <l>Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But because she who spinneth day and night</l>
    <l>For him had not yet drawn the distaff off,</l>
    <l>Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>His soul, which is thy sister and my own,</l>
    <l>In coming upwards could not come alone,</l>
    <l>By reason that it sees not in our fashion.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat</l>
    <l>Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him</l>
    <l>As far on as my school has power to lead.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder</l>
    <l>Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together</l>
    <l>All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In asking he so hit the very eye</l>
    <l>Of my desire, that merely with the hope</l>
    <l>My thirst became the less unsatisfied.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Naught is there,&quot; he began, &quot;that without order</l>
    <l>May the religion of the mountain feel,</l>
    <l>Nor aught that may be foreign to its custom.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Free is it here from every permutation;</l>
    <l>What from itself heaven in itself receiveth</l>
    <l>Can be of this the cause, and naught beside;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow,</l>
    <l>Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls</l>
    <l>Than the short, little stairway of three steps.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Dense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied,</l>
    <l>Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas,</l>
    <l>That often upon earth her region shifts;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>No arid vapour any farther rises</l>
    <l>Than to the top of the three steps I spake of,</l>
    <l>Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Lower down perchance it trembles less or more,</l>
    <l>But, for the wind that in the earth is hidden</l>
    <l>I know not how, up here it never trembled.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It trembles here, whenever any soul</l>
    <l>Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves</l>
    <l>To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of purity the will alone gives proof,</l>
    <l>Which, being wholly free to change its convent,</l>
    <l>Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>First it wills well; but the desire permits not,</l>
    <l>Which divine justice with the self-same will</l>
    <l>There was to sin, upon the torment sets.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I, who have been lying in this pain</l>
    <l>Five hundred years and more, but just now felt</l>
    <l>A free volition for a better seat.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious</l>
    <l>Spirits along the mountain rendering praise</l>
    <l>Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So said he to him; and since we enjoy</l>
    <l>As much in drinking as the thirst is great,</l>
    <l>I could not say how much it did me good.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the wise Leader: &quot;Now I see the net</l>
    <l>That snares you here, and how ye are set free,</l>
    <l>Why the earth quakes, and wherefore ye rejoice.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now who thou wast be pleased that I may know;</l>
    <l>And why so many centuries thou hast here</l>
    <l>Been lying, let me gather from thy words.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;In days when the good Titus, with the aid</l>
    <l>Of the supremest King, avenged the wounds</l>
    <l>Whence issued forth the blood by Judas sold,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Under the name that most endures and honours,</l>
    <l>Was I on earth,&quot; that spirit made reply,</l>
    <l>&quot;Greatly renowned, but not with faith as yet.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My vocal spirit was so sweet, that Rome</l>
    <l>Me, a Thoulousian, drew unto herself,</l>
    <l>Where I deserved to deck my brows with myrtle.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Statius the people name me still on earth;</l>
    <l>I sang of Thebes, and then of great Achilles;</l>
    <l>But on the way fell with my second burden.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The seeds unto my ardour were the sparks</l>
    <l>Of that celestial flame which heated me,</l>
    <l>Whereby more than a thousand have been fired;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of the Aeneid speak I, which to me</l>
    <l>A mother was, and was my nurse in song;</l>
    <l>Without this weighed I not a drachma's weight.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And to have lived upon the earth what time</l>
    <l>Virgilius lived, I would accept one sun</l>
    <l>More than I must ere issuing from my ban.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>These words towards me made Virgilius turn</l>
    <l>With looks that in their silence said, &quot;Be silent!&quot;</l>
    <l>But yet the power that wills cannot do all things;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For tears and laughter are such pursuivants</l>
    <l>Unto the passion from which each springs forth,</l>
    <l>In the most truthful least the will they follow.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I only smiled, as one who gives the wink;</l>
    <l>Whereat the shade was silent, and it gazed</l>
    <l>Into mine eyes, where most expression dwells;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And, &quot;As thou well mayst consummate a labour</l>
    <l>So great,&quot; it said, &quot;why did thy face just now</l>
    <l>Display to me the lightning of a smile?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now am I caught on this side and on that;</l>
    <l>One keeps me silent, one to speak conjures me,</l>
    <l>Wherefore I sigh, and I am understood.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Speak,&quot; said my Master, &quot;and be not afraid</l>
    <l>Of speaking, but speak out, and say to him</l>
    <l>What he demands with such solicitude.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence I: &quot;Thou peradventure marvellest,</l>
    <l>O antique spirit, at the smile I gave;</l>
    <l>But I will have more wonder seize upon thee.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This one, who guides on high these eyes of mine,</l>
    <l>Is that Virgilius, from whom thou didst learn</l>
    <l>To sing aloud of men and of the Gods.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If other cause thou to my smile imputedst,</l>
    <l>Abandon it as false, and trust it was</l>
    <l>Those words which thou hast spoken concerning him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Already he was stooping to embrace</l>
    <l>My Teacher's feet; but he said to him: &quot;Brother,</l>
    <l>Do not; for shade thou art, and shade beholdest.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he uprising: &quot;Now canst thou the sum</l>
    <l>Of love which warms me to thee comprehend,</l>
    <l>When this our vanity I disremember,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Treating a shadow as substantial thing.&quot;</l>
