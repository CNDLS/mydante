  <p>
    <l>Nor speech the going, nor the going that</l>
    <l>Slackened; but talking we went bravely on,</l>
    <l>Even as a vessel urged by a good wind.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And shadows, that appeared things doubly dead,</l>
    <l>From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed</l>
    <l>Wonder at me, aware that I was living.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I, continuing my colloquy,</l>
    <l>Said: &quot;Peradventure he goes up more slowly</l>
    <l>Than he would do, for other people's sake.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But tell me, if thou knowest, where is Piccarda;</l>
    <l>Tell me if any one of note I see</l>
    <l>Among this folk that gazes at me so.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;My sister, who, 'twixt beautiful and good,</l>
    <l>I know not which was more, triumphs rejoicing</l>
    <l>Already in her crown on high Olympus.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So said he first, and then: &quot;'Tis not forbidden</l>
    <l>To name each other here, so milked away</l>
    <l>Is our resemblance by our dieting.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This,&quot; pointing with his finger, &quot;is Buonagiunta,</l>
    <l>Buonagiunta, of Lucca; and that face</l>
    <l>Beyond him there, more peaked than the others,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Has held the holy Church within his arms;</l>
    <l>From Tours was he, and purges by his fasting</l>
    <l>Bolsena's eels and the Vernaccia wine.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He named me many others one by one;</l>
    <l>And all contented seemed at being named,</l>
    <l>So that for this I saw not one dark look.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw for hunger bite the empty air</l>
    <l>Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface,</l>
    <l>Who with his crook had pastured many people.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure</l>
    <l>Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness,</l>
    <l>And he was one who ne'er felt satisfied.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But as he does who scans, and then doth prize</l>
    <l>One more than others, did I him of Lucca,</l>
    <l>Who seemed to take most cognizance of me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He murmured, and I know not what Gentucca</l>
    <l>From that place heard I, where he felt the wound</l>
    <l>Of justice, that doth macerate them so.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O soul,&quot; I said, &quot;that seemest so desirous</l>
    <l>To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee,</l>
    <l>And with thy speech appease thyself and me.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,&quot;</l>
    <l>Began he, &quot;who to thee shall pleasant make</l>
    <l>My city, howsoever men may blame it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;</l>
    <l>If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived,</l>
    <l>True things hereafter will declare it to thee.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But say if him I here behold, who forth</l>
    <l>Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,</l>
    <l>'Ladies, that have intelligence of love?'&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I to him: &quot;One am I, who, whenever</l>
    <l>Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure</l>
    <l>Which he within me dictates, singing go.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O brother, now I see,&quot; he said, &quot;the knot</l>
    <l>Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held</l>
    <l>Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I do perceive full clearly how your pens</l>
    <l>Go closely following after him who dictates,</l>
    <l>Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he who sets himself to go beyond,</l>
    <l>No difference sees from one style to another;&quot;</l>
    <l>And as if satisfied, he held his peace.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as the birds, that winter tow'rds the Nile,</l>
    <l>Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,</l>
    <l>Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In such wise all the people who were there,</l>
    <l>Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,</l>
    <l>Both by their leanness and their wishes light.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as a man, who weary is with trotting,</l>
    <l>Lets his companions onward go, and walks,</l>
    <l>Until he vents the panting of his chest;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So did Forese let the holy flock</l>
    <l>Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,</l>
    <l>&quot;When will it be that I again shall see thee?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;How long,&quot; I answered, &quot;I may live, I know not;</l>
    <l>Yet my return will not so speedy be,</l>
    <l>But I shall sooner in desire arrive;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because the place where I was set to live</l>
    <l>From day to day of good is more depleted,</l>
    <l>And unto dismal ruin seems ordained.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Now go,&quot; he said, &quot;for him most guilty of it</l>
    <l>At a beast's tail behold I dragged along</l>
    <l>Towards the valley where is no repentance.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Faster at every step the beast is going,</l>
    <l>Increasing evermore until it smites him,</l>
    <l>And leaves the body vilely mutilated.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not long those wheels shall turn,&quot; and he uplifted</l>
    <l>His eyes to heaven, &quot;ere shall be clear to thee</l>
    <l>That which my speech no farther can declare.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now stay behind; because the time so precious</l>
    <l>Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much</l>
    <l>By coming onward thus abreast with thee.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop</l>
    <l>A cavalier from out a troop that ride,</l>
    <l>And seeks the honour of the first encounter,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So he with greater strides departed from us;</l>
    <l>And on the road remained I with those two,</l>
    <l>Who were such mighty marshals of the world.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And when before us he had gone so far</l>
    <l>Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants</l>
    <l>As was my understanding to his words,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Appeared to me with laden and living boughs</l>
    <l>Another apple-tree, and not far distant,</l>
    <l>From having but just then turned thitherward.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>People I saw beneath it lift their hands,</l>
    <l>And cry I know not what towards the leaves,</l>
    <l>Like little children eager and deluded,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,</l>
    <l>But, to make very keen their appetite,</l>
    <l>Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then they departed as if undeceived;</l>
    <l>And now we came unto the mighty tree</l>
    <l>Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Pass farther onward without drawing near;</l>
    <l>The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,</l>
    <l>And out of that one has this tree been raised.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus said I know not who among the branches;</l>
    <l>Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself</l>
    <l>Went crowding forward on the side that rises.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Be mindful,&quot; said he, &quot;of the accursed ones</l>
    <l>Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate</l>
    <l>Combated Theseus with their double breasts;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,</l>
    <l>Whence Gideon would not have them for companions</l>
    <l>When he tow'rds Midian the hills descended.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,</l>
    <l>On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,</l>
    <l>Followed forsooth by miserable gains;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then set at large upon the lonely road,</l>
    <l>A thousand steps and more we onward went,</l>
    <l>In contemplation, each without a word.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?&quot;</l>
    <l>Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started</l>
    <l>As terrified and timid beasts are wont.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I raised my head to see who this might be,</l>
    <l>And never in a furnace was there seen</l>
    <l>Metals or glass so lucent and so red</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As one I saw who said: &quot;If it may please you</l>
    <l>To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;</l>
    <l>This way goes he who goeth after peace.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>His aspect had bereft me of my sight,</l>
    <l>So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,</l>
    <l>Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as, the harbinger of early dawn,</l>
    <l>The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,</l>
    <l>Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst</l>
    <l>My front, and felt the moving of the plumes</l>
    <l>That breathed around an odour of ambrosia;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And heard it said: &quot;Blessed are they whom grace</l>
    <l>So much illumines, that the love of taste</l>
    <l>Excites not in their breasts too great desire,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hungering at all times so far as is just.&quot;</l>
