  <p>
    <l>As when he vibrates forth his earliest rays,</l>
    <l>In regions where his Maker shed his blood,</l>
    <l>(The Ebro falling under lofty Libra,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And waters in the Ganges burnt with noon,)</l>
    <l>So stood the Sun; hence was the day departing,</l>
    <l>When the glad Angel of God appeared to us.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Outside the flame he stood upon the verge,</l>
    <l>And chanted forth, &quot;Beati mundo corde,&quot;</l>
    <l>In voice by far more living than our own.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then: &quot;No one farther goes, souls sanctified,</l>
    <l>If first the fire bite not; within it enter,</l>
    <l>And be not deaf unto the song beyond.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When we were close beside him thus he said;</l>
    <l>Wherefore e'en such became I, when I heard him,</l>
    <l>As he is who is put into the grave.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon my clasped hands I straightened me,</l>
    <l>Scanning the fire, and vividly recalling</l>
    <l>The human bodies I had once seen burned.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Towards me turned themselves my good Conductors,</l>
    <l>And unto me Virgilius said: &quot;My son,</l>
    <l>Here may indeed be torment, but not death.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Remember thee, remember! and if I</l>
    <l>On Geryon have safely guided thee,</l>
    <l>What shall I do now I am nearer God?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Believe for certain, shouldst thou stand a full</l>
    <l>Millennium in the bosom of this flame,</l>
    <l>It could not make thee bald a single hair.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if perchance thou think that I deceive thee,</l>
    <l>Draw near to it, and put it to the proof</l>
    <l>With thine own hands upon thy garment's hem.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now lay aside, now lay aside all fear,</l>
    <l>Turn hitherward, and onward come securely;&quot;</l>
    <l>And I still motionless, and 'gainst my conscience!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn,</l>
    <l>Somewhat disturbed he said: &quot;Now look thou, Son,</l>
    <l>'Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids</l>
    <l>The dying Pyramus, and gazed upon her,</l>
    <l>What time the mulberry became vermilion,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even thus, my obduracy being softened,</l>
    <l>I turned to my wise Guide, hearing the name</l>
    <l>That in my memory evermore is welling.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whereat he wagged his head, and said: &quot;How now?</l>
    <l>Shall we stay on this side?&quot; then smiled as one</l>
    <l>Does at a child who's vanquished by an apple.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then into the fire in front of me he entered,</l>
    <l>Beseeching Statius to come after me,</l>
    <l>Who a long way before divided us.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When I was in it, into molten glass</l>
    <l>I would have cast me to refresh myself,</l>
    <l>So without measure was the burning there!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And my sweet Father, to encourage me,</l>
    <l>Discoursing still of Beatrice went on,</l>
    <l>Saying: &quot;Her eyes I seem to see already!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A voice, that on the other side was singing,</l>
    <l>Directed us, and we, attent alone</l>
    <l>On that, came forth where the ascent began.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Venite, benedicti Patris mei,&quot;</l>
    <l>Sounded within a splendour, which was there</l>
    <l>Such it o'ercame me, and I could not look.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;The sun departs,&quot; it added, &quot;and night cometh;</l>
    <l>Tarry ye not, but onward urge your steps,</l>
    <l>So long as yet the west becomes not dark.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Straight forward through the rock the path ascended</l>
    <l>In such a way that I cut off the rays</l>
    <l>Before me of the sun, that now was low.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And of few stairs we yet had made assay,</l>
    <l>Ere by the vanished shadow the sun's setting</l>
    <l>Behind us we perceived, I and my Sages.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And ere in all its parts immeasurable</l>
    <l>The horizon of one aspect had become,</l>
    <l>And Night her boundless dispensation held,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Each of us of a stair had made his bed;</l>
    <l>Because the nature of the mount took from us</l>
    <l>The power of climbing, more than the delight.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as in ruminating passive grow</l>
    <l>The goats, who have been swift and venturesome</l>
    <l>Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot,</l>
    <l>Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff</l>
    <l>Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,</l>
    <l>Passes the night beside his quiet flock,</l>
    <l>Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such at that hour were we, all three of us,</l>
    <l>I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they,</l>
    <l>Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Little could there be seen of things without;</l>
    <l>But through that little I beheld the stars</l>
    <l>More luminous and larger than their wont.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus ruminating, and beholding these,</l>
    <l>Sleep seized upon me,--sleep, that oftentimes</l>
    <l>Before a deed is done has tidings of it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It was the hour, I think, when from the East</l>
    <l>First on the mountain Citherea beamed,</l>
    <l>Who with the fire of love seems always burning;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought</l>
    <l>I saw a lady walking in a meadow,</l>
    <l>Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Know whosoever may my name demand</l>
    <l>That I am Leah, and go moving round</l>
    <l>My beauteous hands to make myself a garland.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To please me at the mirror, here I deck me,</l>
    <l>But never does my sister Rachel leave</l>
    <l>Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she,</l>
    <l>As I am to adorn me with my hands;</l>
    <l>Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And now before the antelucan splendours</l>
    <l>That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise,</l>
    <l>As, home-returning, less remote they lodge,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The darkness fled away on every side,</l>
    <l>And slumber with it; whereupon I rose,</l>
    <l>Seeing already the great Masters risen.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;That apple sweet, which through so many branches</l>
    <l>The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,</l>
    <l>To-day shall put in peace thy hungerings.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Speaking to me, Virgilius of such words</l>
    <l>As these made use; and never were there guerdons</l>
    <l>That could in pleasantness compare with these.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such longing upon longing came upon me</l>
    <l>To be above, that at each step thereafter</l>
    <l>For flight I felt in me the pinions growing.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When underneath us was the stairway all</l>
    <l>Run o'er, and we were on the highest step,</l>
    <l>Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And said: &quot;The temporal fire and the eternal,</l>
    <l>Son, thou hast seen, and to a place art come</l>
    <l>Where of myself no farther I discern.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>By intellect and art I here have brought thee;</l>
    <l>Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth;</l>
    <l>Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Behold the sun, that shines upon thy forehead;</l>
    <l>Behold the grass, the flowerets, and the shrubs</l>
    <l>Which of itself alone this land produces.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes</l>
    <l>Which weeping caused me to come unto thee,</l>
    <l>Thou canst sit down, and thou canst walk among them.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Expect no more or word or sign from me;</l>
    <l>Free and upright and sound is thy free-will,</l>
    <l>And error were it not to do its bidding;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thee o'er thyself I therefore crown and mitre!&quot;</l>
