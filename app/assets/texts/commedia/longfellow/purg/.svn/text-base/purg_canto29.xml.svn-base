    <l>Singing like unto an enamoured lady</l>
    <l>She, with the ending of her words, continued:</l>
    <l>&quot;Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone</l>
    <l>Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous</l>
    <l>One to avoid and one to see the sun,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>She then against the stream moved onward, going</l>
    <l>Along the bank, and I abreast of her,</l>
    <l>Her little steps with little steps attending.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Between her steps and mine were not a hundred,</l>
    <l>When equally the margins gave a turn,</l>
    <l>In such a way, that to the East I faced.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor even thus our way continued far</l>
    <l>Before the lady wholly turned herself</l>
    <l>Unto me, saying, &quot;Brother, look and listen!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And lo! a sudden lustre ran across</l>
    <l>On every side athwart the spacious forest,</l>
    <l>Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But since the lightning ceases as it comes,</l>
    <l>And that continuing brightened more and more,</l>
    <l>Within my thought I said, &quot;What thing is this?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And a delicious melody there ran</l>
    <l>Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal</l>
    <l>Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For there where earth and heaven obedient were,</l>
    <l>The woman only, and but just created,</l>
    <l>Could not endure to stay 'neath any veil;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Underneath which had she devoutly stayed,</l>
    <l>I sooner should have tasted those delights</l>
    <l>Ineffable, and for a longer time.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>While 'mid such manifold first-fruits I walked</l>
    <l>Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,</l>
    <l>And still solicitous of more delights,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In front of us like an enkindled fire</l>
    <l>Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,</l>
    <l>And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,</l>
    <l>Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,</l>
    <l>The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me,</l>
    <l>And with her choir Urania must assist me,</l>
    <l>To put in verse things difficult to think.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A little farther on, seven trees of gold</l>
    <l>In semblance the long space still intervening</l>
    <l>Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But when I had approached so near to them</l>
    <l>The common object, which the sense deceives,</l>
    <l>Lost not by distance any of its marks,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The faculty that lends discourse to reason</l>
    <l>Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,</l>
    <l>And in the voices of the song &quot;Hosanna!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Above them flamed the harness beautiful,</l>
    <l>Far brighter than the moon in the serene</l>
    <l>Of midnight, at the middle of her month.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I turned me round, with admiration filled,</l>
    <l>To good Virgilius, and he answered me</l>
    <l>With visage no less full of wonderment.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then back I turned my face to those high things,</l>
    <l>Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,</l>
    <l>They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The lady chid me: &quot;Why dost thou burn only</l>
    <l>So with affection for the living lights,</l>
    <l>And dost not look at what comes after them?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,</l>
    <l>Coming behind them, garmented in white,</l>
    <l>And such a whiteness never was on earth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The water on my left flank was resplendent,</l>
    <l>And back to me reflected my left side,</l>
    <l>E'en as a mirror, if I looked therein.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When I upon my margin had such post</l>
    <l>That nothing but the stream divided us,</l>
    <l>Better to see I gave my steps repose;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I beheld the flamelets onward go,</l>
    <l>Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,</l>
    <l>And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So that it overhead remained distinct</l>
    <l>With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours</l>
    <l>Whence the sun's bow is made, and Delia's girdle.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>These standards to the rearward longer were</l>
    <l>Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,</l>
    <l>Ten paces were the outermost apart.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Under so fair a heaven as I describe</l>
    <l>The four and twenty Elders, two by two,</l>
    <l>Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>They all of them were singing: &quot;Blessed thou</l>
    <l>Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed</l>
    <l>For evermore shall be thy loveliness.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After the flowers and other tender grasses</l>
    <l>In front of me upon the other margin</l>
    <l>Were disencumbered of that race elect,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as in heaven star followeth after star,</l>
    <l>There came close after them four animals,</l>
    <l>Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Plumed with six wings was every one of them,</l>
    <l>The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus</l>
    <l>If they were living would be such as these.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste</l>
    <l>My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,</l>
    <l>That I in this cannot be prodigal.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But read Ezekiel, who depicteth them</l>
    <l>As he beheld them from the region cold</l>
    <l>Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And such as thou shalt find them in his pages,</l>
    <l>Such were they here; saving that in their plumage</l>
    <l>John is with me, and differeth from him.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The interval between these four contained</l>
    <l>A chariot triumphal on two wheels,</l>
    <l>Which by a Griffin's neck came drawn along;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And upward he extended both his wings</l>
    <l>Between the middle list and three and three,</l>
    <l>So that he injured none by cleaving it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So high they rose that they were lost to sight;</l>
    <l>His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird,</l>
    <l>And white the others with vermilion mingled.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not only Rome with no such splendid car</l>
    <l>E'er gladdened Africanus, or Augustus,</l>
    <l>But poor to it that of the Sun would be,--</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up</l>
    <l>At the importunate orison of Earth,</l>
    <l>When Jove was so mysteriously just.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle</l>
    <l>Came onward dancing; one so very red</l>
    <l>That in the fire she hardly had been noted.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The second was as if her flesh and bones</l>
    <l>Had all been fashioned out of emerald;</l>
    <l>The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And now they seemed conducted by the white,</l>
    <l>Now by the red, and from the song of her</l>
    <l>The others took their step, or slow or swift.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon the left hand four made holiday</l>
    <l>Vested in purple, following the measure</l>
    <l>Of one of them with three eyes m her head.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In rear of all the group here treated of</l>
    <l>Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,</l>
    <l>But like in gait, each dignified and grave.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One showed himself as one of the disciples</l>
    <l>Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature</l>
    <l>Made for the animals she holds most dear;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Contrary care the other manifested,</l>
    <l>With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused</l>
    <l>Terror to me on this side of the river.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect,</l>
    <l>And behind all an aged man alone</l>
    <l>Walking in sleep with countenance acute.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And like the foremost company these seven</l>
    <l>Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce</l>
    <l>No garland round about the head they wore,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But of the rose, and other flowers vermilion;</l>
    <l>At little distance would the sight have sworn</l>
    <l>That all were in a flame above their brows.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And when the car was opposite to me</l>
    <l>Thunder was heard; and all that folk august</l>
    <l>Seemed to have further progress interdicted,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There with the vanward ensigns standing still.</l>
