  <p>
    <l>&quot;O thou who art beyond the sacred river,&quot;</l>
    <l>Turning to me the point of her discourse,</l>
    <l>That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>She recommenced, continuing without pause,</l>
    <l>&quot;Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,</l>
    <l>Thy own confession needs must be conjoined.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My faculties were in so great confusion,</l>
    <l>That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct</l>
    <l>Than by its organs it was set at large.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Awhile she waited; then she said: &quot;What thinkest?</l>
    <l>Answer me; for the mournful memories</l>
    <l>In thee not yet are by the waters injured.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Confusion and dismay together mingled</l>
    <l>Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight</l>
    <l>Was needful to the understanding of it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as a cross-bow breaks, when 'tis discharged</l>
    <l>Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,</l>
    <l>And with less force the arrow hits the mark,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,</l>
    <l>Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,</l>
    <l>And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence she to me: &quot;In those desires of mine</l>
    <l>Which led thee to the loving of that good,</l>
    <l>Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>What trenches lying traverse or what chains</l>
    <l>Didst thou discover, that of passing onward</l>
    <l>Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And what allurements or what vantages</l>
    <l>Upon the forehead of the others showed,</l>
    <l>That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After the heaving of a bitter sigh,</l>
    <l>Hardly had I the voice to make response,</l>
    <l>And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Weeping I said: &quot;The things that present were</l>
    <l>With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,</l>
    <l>Soon as your countenance concealed itself.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And she: &quot;Shouldst thou be silent, or deny</l>
    <l>What thou confessest, not less manifest</l>
    <l>Would be thy fault, by such a Judge 'tis known.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But when from one's own cheeks comes bursting forth</l>
    <l>The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal</l>
    <l>Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame</l>
    <l>For thy transgression, and another time</l>
    <l>Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;</l>
    <l>So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way</l>
    <l>My buried flesh should have directed thee.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Never to thee presented art or nature</l>
    <l>Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein</l>
    <l>I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee</l>
    <l>By reason of my death, what mortal thing</l>
    <l>Should then have drawn thee into its desire?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft</l>
    <l>Of things fallacious to have risen up</l>
    <l>To follow me, who was no longer such.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward</l>
    <l>To wait for further blows, or little girl,</l>
    <l>Or other vanity of such brief use.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The callow birdlet waits for two or three,</l>
    <l>But to the eyes of those already fledged,</l>
    <l>In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as children silent in their shame</l>
    <l>Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,</l>
    <l>And conscious of their fault, and penitent;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So was I standing; and she said: &quot;If thou</l>
    <l>In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard</l>
    <l>And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With less resistance is a robust holm</l>
    <l>Uprooted, either by a native wind</l>
    <l>Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Than I upraised at her command my chin;</l>
    <l>And when she by the beard the face demanded,</l>
    <l>Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as my countenance was lifted up,</l>
    <l>Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful</l>
    <l>Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And, still but little reassured, mine eyes</l>
    <l>Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,</l>
    <l>That is one person only in two natures.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,</l>
    <l>She seemed to me far more her ancient self</l>
    <l>To excel, than others here, when she was here.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,</l>
    <l>That of all other things the one which turned me</l>
    <l>Most to its love became the most my foe.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such self-conviction stung me at the heart</l>
    <l>O'erpowered I fell, and what I then became</l>
    <l>She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then, when the heart restored my outward sense,</l>
    <l>The lady I had found alone, above me</l>
    <l>I saw, and she was saying, &quot;Hold me, hold me.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,</l>
    <l>And, dragging me behind her, she was moving</l>
    <l>Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When I was near unto the blessed shore,</l>
    <l>&quot;Asperges me,&quot; I heard so sweetly sung,</l>
    <l>Remember it I cannot, much less write it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,</l>
    <l>Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,</l>
    <l>Where I was forced to swallow of the water.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought</l>
    <l>Into the dance of the four beautiful,</l>
    <l>And each one with her arm did cover me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;</l>
    <l>Ere Beatrice descended to the world,</l>
    <l>We as her handmaids were appointed her.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We'll lead thee to her eyes; but for the pleasant</l>
    <l>Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine</l>
    <l>The three beyond, who more profoundly look.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus singing they began; and afterwards</l>
    <l>Unto the Griffin's breast they led me with them,</l>
    <l>Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;See that thou dost not spare thine eyes,&quot; they said;</l>
    <l>&quot;Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,</l>
    <l>Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A thousand longings, hotter than the flame,</l>
    <l>Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,</l>
    <l>That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As in a glass the sun, not otherwise</l>
    <l>Within them was the twofold monster shining,</l>
    <l>Now with the one, now with the other nature.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Think, Reader, if within myself I marvelled,</l>
    <l>When I beheld the thing itself stand still,</l>
    <l>And in its image it transformed itself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>While with amazement filled and jubilant,</l>
    <l>My soul was tasting of the food, that while</l>
    <l>It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Themselves revealing of the highest rank</l>
    <l>In bearing, did the other three advance,</l>
    <l>Singing to their angelic saraband.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,&quot;</l>
    <l>Such was their song, &quot;unto thy faithful one,</l>
    <l>Who has to see thee ta'en so many steps.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In grace do us the grace that thou unveil</l>
    <l>Thy face to him, so that he may discern</l>
    <l>The second beauty which thou dost conceal.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O splendour of the living light eternal!</l>
    <l>Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus</l>
    <l>Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He would not seem to have his mind encumbered</l>
    <l>Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear,</l>
    <l>Where the harmonious heaven o'ershadowed thee,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When in the open air thou didst unveil?</l>
