  <p>
    <l>Whenever by delight or else by pain,</l>
    <l>That seizes any faculty of ours,</l>
    <l>Wholly to that the soul collects itself,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It seemeth that no other power it heeds;</l>
    <l>And this against that error is which thinks</l>
    <l>One soul above another kindles in us.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And hence, whenever aught is heard or seen</l>
    <l>Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it,</l>
    <l>Time passes on, and we perceive it not,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because one faculty is that which listens,</l>
    <l>And other that which the soul keeps entire;</l>
    <l>This is as if in bonds, and that is free.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of this I had experience positive</l>
    <l>In hearing and in gazing at that spirit;</l>
    <l>For fifty full degrees uprisen was</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The sun, and I had not perceived it, when</l>
    <l>We came to where those souls with one accord</l>
    <l>Cried out unto us: &quot;Here is what you ask.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A greater opening ofttimes hedges up</l>
    <l>With but a little forkful of his thorns</l>
    <l>The villager, what time the grape imbrowns,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Than was the passage-way through which ascended</l>
    <l>Only my Leader and myself behind him,</l>
    <l>After that company departed from us.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli,</l>
    <l>And mounts the summit of Bismantova,</l>
    <l>With feet alone; but here one needs must fly;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With the swift pinions and the plumes I say</l>
    <l>Of great desire, conducted after him</l>
    <l>Who gave me hope, and made a light for me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We mounted upward through the rifted rock,</l>
    <l>And on each side the border pressed upon us,</l>
    <l>And feet and hands the ground beneath required.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When we were come upon the upper rim</l>
    <l>Of the high bank, out on the open slope,</l>
    <l>&quot;My Master,&quot; said I, &quot;what way shall we take?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;No step of thine descend;</l>
    <l>Still up the mount behind me win thy way,</l>
    <l>Till some sage escort shall appear to us.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The summit was so high it vanquished sight,</l>
    <l>And the hillside precipitous far more</l>
    <l>Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Spent with fatigue was I, when I began:</l>
    <l>&quot;O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold</l>
    <l>How I remain alone, unless thou stay!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O son,&quot; he said, &quot;up yonder drag thyself,&quot;</l>
    <l>Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,</l>
    <l>Which on that side encircles all the hill.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>These words of his so spurred me on, that I</l>
    <l>Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,</l>
    <l>Until the circle was beneath my feet.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereon ourselves we seated both of us</l>
    <l>Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,</l>
    <l>For all men are delighted to look back.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To the low shores mine eyes I first directed,</l>
    <l>Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered</l>
    <l>That on the left hand we were smitten by it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Poet well perceived that I was wholly</l>
    <l>Bewildered at the chariot of the light,</l>
    <l>Where 'twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whereon he said to me: &quot;If Castor and Pollux</l>
    <l>Were in the company of yonder mirror,</l>
    <l>That up and down conducteth with its light,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou wouldst behold the zodiac's jagged wheel</l>
    <l>Revolving still more near unto the Bears,</l>
    <l>Unless it swerved aside from its old track.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>How that may be wouldst thou have power to think,</l>
    <l>Collected in thyself, imagine Zion</l>
    <l>Together with this mount on earth to stand,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So that they both one sole horizon have,</l>
    <l>And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road</l>
    <l>Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou'lt see how of necessity must pass</l>
    <l>This on one side, when that upon the other,</l>
    <l>If thine intelligence right clearly heed.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Truly, my Master,&quot; said I, &quot;never yet</l>
    <l>Saw I so clearly as I now discern,</l>
    <l>There where my wit appeared incompetent,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That the mid-circle of supernal motion,</l>
    <l>Which in some art is the Equator called,</l>
    <l>And aye remains between the Sun and Winter,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For reason which thou sayest, departeth hence</l>
    <l>Tow'rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews</l>
    <l>Beheld it tow'rds the region of the heat.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn</l>
    <l>How far we have to go; for the hill rises</l>
    <l>Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;This mount is such, that ever</l>
    <l>At the beginning down below 'tis tiresome,</l>
    <l>And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,</l>
    <l>That going up shall be to thee as easy</l>
    <l>As going down the current in a boat,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then at this pathway's ending thou wilt be;</l>
    <l>There to repose thy panting breath expect;</l>
    <l>No more I answer; and this I know for true.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as he finished uttering these words,</l>
    <l>A voice close by us sounded: &quot;Peradventure</l>
    <l>Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>At sound thereof each one of us turned round,</l>
    <l>And saw upon the left hand a great rock,</l>
    <l>Which neither I nor he before had noticed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thither we drew; and there were persons there</l>
    <l>Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,</l>
    <l>As one through indolence is wont to stand.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,</l>
    <l>Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,</l>
    <l>Holding his face low down between them bowed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O my sweet Lord,&quot; I said, &quot;do turn thine eye</l>
    <l>On him who shows himself more negligent</l>
    <l>Then even Sloth herself his sister were.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,</l>
    <l>Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,</l>
    <l>And said: &quot;Now go thou up, for thou art valiant.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then knew I who he was; and the distress,</l>
    <l>That still a little did my breathing quicken,</l>
    <l>My going to him hindered not; and after</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I came to him he hardly raised his head,</l>
    <l>Saying: &quot;Hast thou seen clearly how the sun</l>
    <l>O'er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>His sluggish attitude and his curt words</l>
    <l>A little unto laughter moved my lips;</l>
    <l>Then I began: &quot;Belacqua, I grieve not</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated</l>
    <l>In this place art thou?  Waitest thou an escort?</l>
    <l>Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he: &quot;O brother, what's the use of climbing?</l>
    <l>Since to my torment would not let me go</l>
    <l>The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>First heaven must needs so long revolve me round</l>
    <l>Outside thereof, as in my life it did,</l>
    <l>Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Unless, e'er that, some prayer may bring me aid</l>
    <l>Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;</l>
    <l>What profit others that in heaven are heard not?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,</l>
    <l>And saying: &quot;Come now; see the sun has touched</l>
    <l>Meridian, and from the shore the night</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Covers already with her foot Morocco.&quot;</l>
