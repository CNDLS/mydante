  <p>
    <l>The concubine of old Tithonus now</l>
    <l>Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony,</l>
    <l>Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With gems her forehead all relucent was,</l>
    <l>Set in the shape of that cold animal</l>
    <l>Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And of the steps, with which she mounts, the Night</l>
    <l>Had taken two in that place where we were,</l>
    <l>And now the third was bending down its wings;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When I, who something had of Adam in me,</l>
    <l>Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined,</l>
    <l>There were all five of us already sat.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Just at the hour when her sad lay begins</l>
    <l>The little swallow, near unto the morning,</l>
    <l>Perchance in memory of her former woes,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And when the mind of man, a wanderer</l>
    <l>More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,</l>
    <l>Almost prophetic in its visions is,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended</l>
    <l>An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,</l>
    <l>With wings wide open, and intent to stoop,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And this, it seemed to me, was where had been</l>
    <l>By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned,</l>
    <l>When to the high consistory he was rapt.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I thought within myself, perchance he strikes</l>
    <l>From habit only here, and from elsewhere</l>
    <l>Disdains to bear up any in his feet.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me,</l>
    <l>Terrible as the lightning he descended,</l>
    <l>And snatched me upward even to the fire.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therein it seemed that he and I were burning,</l>
    <l>And the imagined fire did scorch me so,</l>
    <l>That of necessity my sleep was broken.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not otherwise Achilles started up,</l>
    <l>Around him turning his awakened eyes,</l>
    <l>And knowing not the place in which he was,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>What time from Chiron stealthily his mother</l>
    <l>Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros,</l>
    <l>Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Than I upstarted, when from off my face</l>
    <l>Sleep fled away; and pallid I became,</l>
    <l>As doth the man who freezes with affright.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Only my Comforter was at my side,</l>
    <l>And now the sun was more than two hours high,</l>
    <l>And turned towards the sea-shore was my face.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Be not intimidated,&quot; said my Lord,</l>
    <l>&quot;Be reassured, for all is well with us;</l>
    <l>Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou hast at length arrived at Purgatory;</l>
    <l>See there the cliff that closes it around;</l>
    <l>See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,</l>
    <l>When inwardly thy spirit was asleep</l>
    <l>Upon the flowers that deck the land below,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There came a Lady and said: 'I am Lucia;</l>
    <l>Let me take this one up, who is asleep;</l>
    <l>So will I make his journey easier for him.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Sordello and the other noble shapes</l>
    <l>Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,</l>
    <l>Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>She laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes</l>
    <l>That open entrance pointed out to me;</l>
    <l>Then she and sleep together went away.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In guise of one whose doubts are reassured,</l>
    <l>And who to confidence his fear doth change,</l>
    <l>After the truth has been discovered to him,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So did I change; and when without disquiet</l>
    <l>My Leader saw me, up along the cliff</l>
    <l>He moved, and I behind him, tow'rd the height.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Reader, thou seest well how I exalt</l>
    <l>My theme, and therefore if with greater art</l>
    <l>I fortify it, marvel not thereat.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nearer approached we, and were in such place,</l>
    <l>That there, where first appeared to me a rift</l>
    <l>Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,</l>
    <l>Diverse in colour, to go up to it,</l>
    <l>And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as I opened more and more mine eyes,</l>
    <l>I saw him seated on the highest stair,</l>
    <l>Such in the face that I endured it not.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And in his hand he had a naked sword,</l>
    <l>Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow'rds us,</l>
    <l>That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Tell it from where you are, what is't you wish?&quot;</l>
    <l>Began he to exclaim; &quot;where is the escort?</l>
    <l>Take heed your coming hither harm you not!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,&quot;</l>
    <l>My Master answered him, &quot;but even now</l>
    <l>Said to us, 'Thither go; there is the portal.'&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;And may she speed your footsteps in all good,&quot;</l>
    <l>Again began the courteous janitor;</l>
    <l>&quot;Come forward then unto these stairs of ours.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thither did we approach; and the first stair</l>
    <l>Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,</l>
    <l>I mirrored myself therein as I appear.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,</l>
    <l>Was of a calcined and uneven stone,</l>
    <l>Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The third, that uppermost rests massively,</l>
    <l>Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red</l>
    <l>As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Both of his feet was holding upon this</l>
    <l>The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,</l>
    <l>Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Along the three stairs upward with good will</l>
    <l>Did my Conductor draw me, saying: &quot;Ask</l>
    <l>Humbly that he the fastening may undo.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me,</l>
    <l>For mercy's sake besought that he would open,</l>
    <l>But first upon my breast three times I smote.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Seven P's upon my forehead he described</l>
    <l>With the sword's point, and, &quot;Take heed that thou wash</l>
    <l>These wounds, when thou shalt be within,&quot; he said.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,</l>
    <l>Of the same colour were with his attire,</l>
    <l>And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One was of gold, and the other was of silver;</l>
    <l>First with the white, and after with the yellow,</l>
    <l>Plied he the door, so that I was content.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Whenever faileth either of these keys</l>
    <l>So that it turn not rightly in the lock,&quot;</l>
    <l>He said to us, &quot;this entrance doth not open.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>More precious one is, but the other needs</l>
    <l>More art and intellect ere it unlock,</l>
    <l>For it is that which doth the knot unloose.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From Peter I have them; and he bade me err</l>
    <l>Rather in opening than in keeping shut,</l>
    <l>If people but fall down before my feet.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then pushed the portals of the sacred door,</l>
    <l>Exclaiming: &quot;Enter; but I give you warning</l>
    <l>That forth returns whoever looks behind.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And when upon their hinges were turned round</l>
    <l>The swivels of that consecrated gate,</l>
    <l>Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Roared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed</l>
    <l>Tarpeia, when was ta'en from it the good</l>
    <l>Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,</l>
    <l>And &quot;Te Deum laudamus&quot; seemed to hear</l>
    <l>In voices mingled with sweet melody.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Exactly such an image rendered me</l>
    <l>That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,</l>
    <l>When people singing with the organ stand;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For now we hear, and now hear not, the words.</l>
