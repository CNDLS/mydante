  <p>
    <l>Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight</l>
    <l>Had scattered them asunder o'er the plain,</l>
    <l>Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,</l>
    <l>And how without him had I kept my course?</l>
    <l>Who would have led me up along the mountain?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He seemed to me within himself remorseful;</l>
    <l>O noble conscience, and without a stain,</l>
    <l>How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After his feet had laid aside the haste</l>
    <l>Which mars the dignity of every act,</l>
    <l>My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Let loose its faculties as if delighted,</l>
    <l>And I my sight directed to the hill</l>
    <l>That highest tow'rds the heaven uplifts itself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,</l>
    <l>Was broken in front of me into the figure</l>
    <l>Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Unto one side I turned me, with the fear</l>
    <l>Of being left alone, when I beheld</l>
    <l>Only in front of me the ground obscured.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Why dost thou still mistrust?&quot; my Comforter</l>
    <l>Began to say to me turned wholly round;</l>
    <l>&quot;Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'Tis evening there already where is buried</l>
    <l>The body within which I cast a shadow;</l>
    <l>'Tis from Brundusium ta'en, and Naples has it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now if in front of me no shadow fall,</l>
    <l>Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,</l>
    <l>Because one ray impedeth not another</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,</l>
    <l>Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills</l>
    <l>That how it works be not unveiled to us.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Insane is he who hopeth that our reason</l>
    <l>Can traverse the illimitable way,</l>
    <l>Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Mortals, remain contented at the 'Quia;'</l>
    <l>For if ye had been able to see all,</l>
    <l>No need there were for Mary to give birth;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And ye have seen desiring without fruit,</l>
    <l>Those whose desire would have been quieted,</l>
    <l>Which evermore is given them for a grief.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,</l>
    <l>And many others;&quot;--and here bowed his head,</l>
    <l>And more he said not, and remained disturbed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We came meanwhile unto the mountain's foot;</l>
    <l>There so precipitate we found the rock,</l>
    <l>That nimble legs would there have been in vain.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,</l>
    <l>The most secluded pathway is a stair</l>
    <l>Easy and open, if compared with that.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill</l>
    <l>Slopes down,&quot; my Master said, his footsteps staying,</l>
    <l>&quot;So that who goeth without wings may mount?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And while he held his eyes upon the ground</l>
    <l>Examining the nature of the path,</l>
    <l>And I was looking up around the rock,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On the left hand appeared to me a throng</l>
    <l>Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,</l>
    <l>And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Lift up thine eyes,&quot; I to the Master said;</l>
    <l>&quot;Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,</l>
    <l>If thou of thine own self can have it not.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then he looked at me, and with frank expression</l>
    <l>Replied: &quot;Let us go there, for they come slowly,</l>
    <l>And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Still was that people as far off from us,</l>
    <l>After a thousand steps of ours I say,</l>
    <l>As a good thrower with his hand would reach,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When they all crowded unto the hard masses</l>
    <l>Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,</l>
    <l>As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O happy dead!  O spirits elect already!&quot;</l>
    <l>Virgilius made beginning, &quot;by that peace</l>
    <l>Which I believe is waiting for you all,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,</l>
    <l>So that the going up be possible,</l>
    <l>For to lose time irks him most who most knows.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold</l>
    <l>By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand</l>
    <l>Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And what the foremost does the others do,</l>
    <l>Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,</l>
    <l>Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So moving to approach us thereupon</l>
    <l>I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,</l>
    <l>Modest in face and dignified in gait.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As soon as those in the advance saw broken</l>
    <l>The light upon the ground at my right side,</l>
    <l>So that from me the shadow reached the rock,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;</l>
    <l>And all the others, who came after them,</l>
    <l>Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Without your asking, I confess to you</l>
    <l>This is a human body which you see,</l>
    <l>Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded</l>
    <l>That not without a power which comes from Heaven</l>
    <l>Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Master thus; and said those worthy people:</l>
    <l>&quot;Return ye then, and enter in before us,&quot;</l>
    <l>Making a signal with the back o' the hand</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And one of them began: &quot;Whoe'er thou art,</l>
    <l>Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well</l>
    <l>If e'er thou saw me in the other world.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I turned me tow'rds him, and looked at him closely;</l>
    <l>Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,</l>
    <l>But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When with humility I had disclaimed</l>
    <l>E'er having seen him, &quot;Now behold!&quot; he said,</l>
    <l>And showed me high upon his breast a wound.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then said he with a smile: &quot;I am Manfredi,</l>
    <l>The grandson of the Empress Costanza;</l>
    <l>Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother</l>
    <l>Of Sicily's honour and of Aragon's,</l>
    <l>And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After I had my body lacerated</l>
    <l>By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself</l>
    <l>Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Horrible my iniquities had been;</l>
    <l>But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,</l>
    <l>That it receives whatever turns to it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Had but Cosenza's pastor, who in chase</l>
    <l>Of me was sent by Clement at that time,</l>
    <l>In God read understandingly this page,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The bones of my dead body still would be</l>
    <l>At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,</l>
    <l>Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,</l>
    <l>Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde,</l>
    <l>Where he transported them with tapers quenched.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>By malison of theirs is not so lost</l>
    <l>Eternal Love, that it cannot return,</l>
    <l>So long as hope has anything of green.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>True is it, who in contumacy dies</l>
    <l>Of Holy Church, though penitent at last,</l>
    <l>Must wait upon the outside this bank</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thirty times told the time that he has been</l>
    <l>In his presumption, unless such decree</l>
    <l>Shorter by means of righteous prayers become.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>See now if thou hast power to make me happy,</l>
    <l>By making known unto my good Costanza</l>
    <l>How thou hast seen me, and this ban beside,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For those on earth can much advance us here.&quot;</l>
