  <p>
    <l>I had already from those shades departed,</l>
    <l>And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,</l>
    <l>When from behind, pointing his finger at me,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One shouted: &quot;See, it seems as if shone not</l>
    <l>The sunshine on the left of him below,</l>
    <l>And like one living seems he to conduct him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,</l>
    <l>And saw them watching with astonishment</l>
    <l>But me, but me, and the light which was broken!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,&quot;</l>
    <l>The Master said, &quot;that thou thy pace dost slacken?</l>
    <l>What matters it to thee what here is whispered?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Come after me, and let the people talk;</l>
    <l>Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags</l>
    <l>Its top for all the blowing of the winds;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For evermore the man in whom is springing</l>
    <l>Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,</l>
    <l>Because the force of one the other weakens.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>What could I say in answer but &quot;I come&quot;?</l>
    <l>I said it somewhat with that colour tinged</l>
    <l>Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Meanwhile along the mountain-side across</l>
    <l>Came people in advance of us a little,</l>
    <l>Singing the Miserere verse by verse.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When they became aware I gave no place</l>
    <l>For passage of the sunshine through my body,</l>
    <l>They changed their song into a long, hoarse &quot;Oh!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And two of them, in form of messengers,</l>
    <l>Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,</l>
    <l>&quot;Of your condition make us cognisant.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And said my Master: &quot;Ye can go your way</l>
    <l>And carry back again to those who sent you,</l>
    <l>That this one's body is of very flesh.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If they stood still because they saw his shadow,</l>
    <l>As I suppose, enough is answered them;</l>
    <l>Him let them honour, it may profit them.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Vapours enkindled saw I ne'er so swiftly</l>
    <l>At early nightfall cleave the air serene,</l>
    <l>Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But upward they returned in briefer time,</l>
    <l>And, on arriving, with the others wheeled</l>
    <l>Tow'rds us, like troops that run without a rein.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;This folk that presses unto us is great,</l>
    <l>And cometh to implore thee,&quot; said the Poet;</l>
    <l>&quot;So still go onward, and in going listen.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O soul that goest to beatitude</l>
    <l>With the same members wherewith thou wast born,&quot;</l>
    <l>Shouting they came, &quot;a little stay thy steps,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Look, if thou e'er hast any of us seen,</l>
    <l>So that o'er yonder thou bear news of him;</l>
    <l>Ah, why dost thou go on?  Ah, why not stay?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Long since we all were slain by violence,</l>
    <l>And sinners even to the latest hour;</l>
    <l>Then did a light from heaven admonish us,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth</l>
    <l>From life we issued reconciled to God,</l>
    <l>Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I: &quot;Although I gaze into your faces,</l>
    <l>No one I recognize; but if may please you</l>
    <l>Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Speak ye, and I will do it, by that peace</l>
    <l>Which, following the feet of such a Guide,</l>
    <l>From world to world makes itself sought by me.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And one began: &quot;Each one has confidence</l>
    <l>In thy good offices without an oath,</l>
    <l>Unless the I cannot cut off the I will;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence I, who speak alone before the others,</l>
    <l>Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land</l>
    <l>That 'twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou be so courteous to me of thy prayers</l>
    <l>In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly,</l>
    <l>That I may purge away my grave offences.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which</l>
    <l>Issued the blood wherein I had my seat,</l>
    <l>Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There where I thought to be the most secure;</l>
    <l>'Twas he of Este had it done, who held me</l>
    <l>In hatred far beyond what justice willed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But if towards the Mira I had fled,</l>
    <l>When I was overtaken at Oriaco,</l>
    <l>I still should be o'er yonder where men breathe.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire</l>
    <l>Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there</l>
    <l>A lake made from my veins upon the ground.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then said another: &quot;Ah, be that desire</l>
    <l>Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,</l>
    <l>As thou with pious pity aidest mine.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte;</l>
    <l>Giovanna, nor none other cares for me;</l>
    <l>Hence among these I go with downcast front.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I to him: &quot;What violence or what chance</l>
    <l>Led thee astray so far from Campaldino,</l>
    <l>That never has thy sepulture been known?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Oh,&quot; he replied, &quot;at Casentino's foot</l>
    <l>A river crosses named Archiano, born</l>
    <l>Above the Hermitage in Apennine.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There where the name thereof becometh void</l>
    <l>Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,</l>
    <l>Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There my sight lost I, and my utterance</l>
    <l>Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat</l>
    <l>I fell, and tenantless my flesh remained.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living;</l>
    <l>God's Angel took me up, and he of hell</l>
    <l>Shouted: 'O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou bearest away the eternal part of him,</l>
    <l>For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;</l>
    <l>But with the rest I'll deal in other fashion!'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Well knowest thou how in the air is gathered</l>
    <l>That humid vapour which to water turns,</l>
    <l>Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He joined that evil will, which aye seeks evil,</l>
    <l>To intellect, and moved the mist and wind</l>
    <l>By means of power, which his own nature gave;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereafter, when the day was spent, the valley</l>
    <l>From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered</l>
    <l>With fog, and made the heaven above intent,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So that the pregnant air to water changed;</l>
    <l>Down fell the rain, and to the gullies came</l>
    <l>Whate'er of it earth tolerated not;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as it mingled with the mighty torrents,</l>
    <l>Towards the royal river with such speed</l>
    <l>It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My frozen body near unto its outlet</l>
    <l>The robust Archian found, and into Arno</l>
    <l>Thrust it, and loosened from my breast the cross</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I made of me, when agony o'ercame me;</l>
    <l>It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom,</l>
    <l>Then with its booty covered and begirt me.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Ah, when thou hast returned unto the world,</l>
    <l>And rested thee from thy long journeying,&quot;</l>
    <l>After the second followed the third spirit,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Do thou remember me who am the Pia;</l>
    <l>Siena made me, unmade me Maremma;</l>
    <l>He knoweth it, who had encircled first,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Espousing me, my finger with his gem.&quot;</l>
