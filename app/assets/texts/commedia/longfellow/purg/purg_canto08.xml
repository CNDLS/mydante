    <l>'Twas now the hour that turneth back desire</l>
    <l>In those who sail the sea, and melts the heart,</l>
    <l>The day they've said to their sweet friends farewell,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And the new pilgrim penetrates with love,</l>
    <l>If he doth hear from far away a bell</l>
    <l>That seemeth to deplore the dying day,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When I began to make of no avail</l>
    <l>My hearing, and to watch one of the souls</l>
    <l>Uprisen, that begged attention with its hand.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It joined and lifted upward both its palms,</l>
    <l>Fixing its eyes upon the orient,</l>
    <l>As if it said to God, &quot;Naught else I care for.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Te lucis ante&quot; so devoutly issued</l>
    <l>Forth from its mouth, and with such dulcet notes,</l>
    <l>It made me issue forth from my own mind.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And then the others, sweetly and devoutly,</l>
    <l>Accompanied it through all the hymn entire,</l>
    <l>Having their eyes on the supernal wheels.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Here, Reader, fix thine eyes well on the truth,</l>
    <l>For now indeed so subtile is the veil,</l>
    <l>Surely to penetrate within is easy.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw that army of the gentle-born</l>
    <l>Thereafterward in silence upward gaze,</l>
    <l>As if in expectation, pale and humble;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And from on high come forth and down descend,</l>
    <l>I saw two Angels with two flaming swords,</l>
    <l>Truncated and deprived of their points.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Green as the little leaflets just now born</l>
    <l>Their garments were, which, by their verdant pinions</l>
    <l>Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One just above us came to take his station,</l>
    <l>And one descended to the opposite bank,</l>
    <l>So that the people were contained between them.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Clearly in them discerned I the blond head;</l>
    <l>But in their faces was the eye bewildered,</l>
    <l>As faculty confounded by excess.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;From Mary's bosom both of them have come,&quot;</l>
    <l>Sordello said, &quot;as guardians of the valley</l>
    <l>Against the serpent, that will come anon.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whereupon I, who knew not by what road,</l>
    <l>Turned round about, and closely drew myself,</l>
    <l>Utterly frozen, to the faithful shoulders.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And once again Sordello: &quot;Now descend we</l>
    <l>'Mid the grand shades, and we will speak to them;</l>
    <l>Right pleasant will it be for them to see you.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Only three steps I think that I descended,</l>
    <l>And was below, and saw one who was looking</l>
    <l>Only at me, as if he fain would know me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Already now the air was growing dark,</l>
    <l>But not so that between his eyes and mine</l>
    <l>It did not show what it before locked up.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Tow'rds me he moved, and I tow'rds him did move;</l>
    <l>Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted,</l>
    <l>When I beheld thee not among the damned!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>No greeting fair was left unsaid between us;</l>
    <l>Then asked he: &quot;How long is it since thou camest</l>
    <l>O'er the far waters to the mountain's foot?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Oh!&quot; said I to him, &quot;through the dismal places</l>
    <l>I came this morn; and am in the first life,</l>
    <l>Albeit the other, going thus, I gain.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And on the instant my reply was heard,</l>
    <l>He and Sordello both shrank back from me,</l>
    <l>Like people who are suddenly bewildered.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One to Virgilius, and the other turned</l>
    <l>To one who sat there, crying, &quot;Up, Currado!</l>
    <l>Come and behold what God in grace has willed!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then, turned to me: &quot;By that especial grace</l>
    <l>Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals</l>
    <l>His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,</l>
    <l>Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,</l>
    <l>Where answer to the innocent is made.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I do not think her mother loves me more,</l>
    <l>Since she has laid aside her wimple white,</l>
    <l>Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Through her full easily is comprehended</l>
    <l>How long in woman lasts the fire of love,</l>
    <l>If eye or touch do not relight it often.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So fair a hatchment will not make for her</l>
    <l>The Viper marshalling the Milanese</l>
    <l>A-field, as would have made Gallura's Cock.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed</l>
    <l>Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal</l>
    <l>Which measurably burneth in the heart.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,</l>
    <l>Still to that point where slowest are the stars,</l>
    <l>Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And my Conductor: &quot;Son, what dost thou gaze at</l>
    <l>Up there?&quot;  And I to him: &quot;At those three torches</l>
    <l>With which this hither pole is all on fire.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;The four resplendent stars</l>
    <l>Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,</l>
    <l>And these have mounted up to where those were.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As he was speaking, to himself Sordello</l>
    <l>Drew him, and said, &quot;Lo there our Adversary!&quot;</l>
    <l>And pointed with his finger to look thither.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon the side on which the little valley</l>
    <l>No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance</l>
    <l>The same which gave to Eve the bitter food.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>'Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,</l>
    <l>Turning at times its head about, and licking</l>
    <l>Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I did not see, and therefore cannot say</l>
    <l>How the celestial falcons 'gan to move,</l>
    <l>But well I saw that they were both in motion.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,</l>
    <l>The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,</l>
    <l>Up to their stations flying back alike.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The shade that to the Judge had near approached</l>
    <l>When he had called, throughout that whole assault</l>
    <l>Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;So may the light that leadeth thee on high</l>
    <l>Find in thine own free-will as much of wax</l>
    <l>As needful is up to the highest azure,&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Began it, &quot;if some true intelligence</l>
    <l>Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood</l>
    <l>Thou knowest, tell it me, who once was great there.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Currado Malaspina was I called;</l>
    <l>I'm not the elder, but from him descended;</l>
    <l>To mine I bore the love which here refineth.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O,&quot; said I unto him, &quot;through your domains</l>
    <l>I never passed, but where is there a dwelling</l>
    <l>Throughout all Europe, where they are not known?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That fame, which doeth honour to your house,</l>
    <l>Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land,</l>
    <l>So that he knows of them who ne'er was there.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And, as I hope for heaven, I swear to you</l>
    <l>Your honoured family in naught abates</l>
    <l>The glory of the purse and of the sword.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It is so privileged by use and nature,</l>
    <l>That though a guilty head misguide the world,</l>
    <l>Sole it goes right, and scorns the evil way.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he: &quot;Now go; for the sun shall not lie</l>
    <l>Seven times upon the pillow which the Ram</l>
    <l>With all his four feet covers and bestrides,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Before that such a courteous opinion</l>
    <l>Shall in the middle of thy head be nailed</l>
    <l>With greater nails than of another's speech,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Unless the course of justice standeth still.&quot;</l>
