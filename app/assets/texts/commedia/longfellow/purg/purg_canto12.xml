  <p>
    <l>Abreast, like oxen going in a yoke,</l>
    <l>I with that heavy-laden soul went on,</l>
    <l>As long as the sweet pedagogue permitted;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But when he said, &quot;Leave him, and onward pass,</l>
    <l>For here 'tis good that with the sail and oars,</l>
    <l>As much as may be, each push on his barque;&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upright, as walking wills it, I redressed</l>
    <l>My person, notwithstanding that my thoughts</l>
    <l>Remained within me downcast and abashed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I had moved on, and followed willingly</l>
    <l>The footsteps of my Master, and we both</l>
    <l>Already showed how light of foot we were,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When unto me he said: &quot;Cast down thine eyes;</l>
    <l>'Twere well for thee, to alleviate the way,</l>
    <l>To look upon the bed beneath thy feet.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As, that some memory may exist of them,</l>
    <l>Above the buried dead their tombs in earth</l>
    <l>Bear sculptured on them what they were before;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence often there we weep for them afresh,</l>
    <l>From pricking of remembrance, which alone</l>
    <l>To the compassionate doth set its spur;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So saw I there, but of a better semblance</l>
    <l>In point of artifice, with figures covered</l>
    <l>Whate'er as pathway from the mount projects.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw that one who was created noble</l>
    <l>More than all other creatures, down from heaven</l>
    <l>Flaming with lightnings fall upon one side.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw Briareus smitten by the dart</l>
    <l>Celestial, lying on the other side,</l>
    <l>Heavy upon the earth by mortal frost.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw Thymbraeus, Pallas saw, and Mars,</l>
    <l>Still clad in armour round about their father,</l>
    <l>Gaze at the scattered members of the giants.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw, at foot of his great labour, Nimrod,</l>
    <l>As if bewildered, looking at the people</l>
    <l>Who had been proud with him in Sennaar.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O Niobe! with what afflicted eyes</l>
    <l>Thee I beheld upon the pathway traced,</l>
    <l>Between thy seven and seven children slain!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O Saul! how fallen upon thy proper sword</l>
    <l>Didst thou appear there lifeless in Gilboa,</l>
    <l>That felt thereafter neither rain nor dew!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O mad Arachne! so I thee beheld</l>
    <l>E'en then half spider, sad upon the shreds</l>
    <l>Of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>O Rehoboam! no more seems to threaten</l>
    <l>Thine image there; but full of consternation</l>
    <l>A chariot bears it off, when none pursues!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Displayed moreo'er the adamantine pavement</l>
    <l>How unto his own mother made Alcmaeon</l>
    <l>Costly appear the luckless ornament;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Displayed how his own sons did throw themselves</l>
    <l>Upon Sennacherib within the temple,</l>
    <l>And how, he being dead, they left him there;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Displayed the ruin and the cruel carnage</l>
    <l>That Tomyris wrought, when she to Cyrus said,</l>
    <l>&quot;Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Displayed how routed fled the Assyrians</l>
    <l>After that Holofernes had been slain,</l>
    <l>And likewise the remainder of that slaughter.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw there Troy in ashes and in caverns;</l>
    <l>O Ilion! thee, how abject and debased,</l>
    <l>Displayed the image that is there discerned!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whoe'er of pencil master was or stile,</l>
    <l>That could portray the shades and traits which there</l>
    <l>Would cause each subtile genius to admire?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Dead seemed the dead, the living seemed alive;</l>
    <l>Better than I saw not who saw the truth,</l>
    <l>All that I trod upon while bowed I went.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now wax ye proud, and on with looks uplifted,</l>
    <l>Ye sons of Eve, and bow not down your faces</l>
    <l>So that ye may behold your evil ways!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>More of the mount by us was now encompassed,</l>
    <l>And far more spent the circuit of the sun,</l>
    <l>Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When he, who ever watchful in advance</l>
    <l>Was going on, began: &quot;Lift up thy head,</l>
    <l>'Tis no more time to go thus meditating.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Lo there an Angel who is making haste</l>
    <l>To come towards us; lo, returning is</l>
    <l>From service of the day the sixth handmaiden.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With reverence thine acts and looks adorn,</l>
    <l>So that he may delight to speed us upward;</l>
    <l>Think that this day will never dawn again.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I was familiar with his admonition</l>
    <l>Ever to lose no time; so on this theme</l>
    <l>He could not unto me speak covertly.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Towards us came the being beautiful</l>
    <l>Vested in white, and in his countenance</l>
    <l>Such as appears the tremulous morning star.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>His arms he opened, and opened then his wings;</l>
    <l>&quot;Come,&quot; said he, &quot;near at hand here are the steps,</l>
    <l>And easy from henceforth is the ascent.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>At this announcement few are they who come!</l>
    <l>O human creatures, born to soar aloft,</l>
    <l>Why fall ye thus before a little wind?</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He led us on to where the rock was cleft;</l>
    <l>There smote upon my forehead with his wings,</l>
    <l>Then a safe passage promised unto me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As on the right hand, to ascend the mount</l>
    <l>Where seated is the church that lordeth it</l>
    <l>O'er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken</l>
    <l>By stairways that were made there in the age</l>
    <l>When still were safe the ledger and the stave,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>E'en thus attempered is the bank which falls</l>
    <l>Sheer downward from the second circle there;</l>
    <l>But on this, side and that the high rock graze.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As we were turning thitherward our persons,</l>
    <l>&quot;Beati pauperes spiritu,&quot; voices</l>
    <l>Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ah me! how different are these entrances</l>
    <l>From the Infernal! for with anthems here</l>
    <l>One enters, and below with wild laments.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>We now were hunting up the sacred stairs,</l>
    <l>And it appeared to me by far more easy</l>
    <l>Than on the plain it had appeared before.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence I: &quot;My Master, say, what heavy thing</l>
    <l>Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly</l>
    <l>Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He answered: &quot;When the P's which have remained</l>
    <l>Still on thy face almost obliterate</l>
    <l>Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,</l>
    <l>That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,</l>
    <l>But urging up will be to them delight.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then did I even as they do who are going</l>
    <l>With something on the head to them unknown,</l>
    <l>Unless the signs of others make them doubt,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,</l>
    <l>And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office</l>
    <l>Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And with the fingers of the right hand spread</l>
    <l>I found but six the letters, that had carved</l>
    <l>Upon my temples he who bore the keys;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.</l>
