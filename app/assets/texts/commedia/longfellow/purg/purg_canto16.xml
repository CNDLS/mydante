  <p>
    <l>Darkness of hell, and of a night deprived</l>
    <l>Of every planet under a poor sky,</l>
    <l>As much as may be tenebrous with cloud,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ne'er made unto my sight so thick a veil,</l>
    <l>As did that smoke which there enveloped us,</l>
    <l>Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For not an eye it suffered to stay open;</l>
    <l>Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,</l>
    <l>Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>E'en as a blind man goes behind his guide,</l>
    <l>Lest he should wander, or should strike against</l>
    <l>Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So went I through the bitter and foul air,</l>
    <l>Listening unto my Leader, who said only,</l>
    <l>&quot;Look that from me thou be not separated.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Voices I heard, and every one appeared</l>
    <l>To supplicate for peace and misericord</l>
    <l>The Lamb of God who takes away our sins.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Still &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; their exordium was;</l>
    <l>One word there was in all, and metre one,</l>
    <l>So that all harmony appeared among them.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Master,&quot; I said, &quot;are spirits those I hear?&quot;</l>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;Thou apprehendest truly,</l>
    <l>And they the knot of anger go unloosing.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke</l>
    <l>And art discoursing of us even as though</l>
    <l>Thou didst by calends still divide the time?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After this manner by a voice was spoken;</l>
    <l>Whereon my Master said: &quot;Do thou reply,</l>
    <l>And ask if on this side the way go upward.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I: &quot;O creature that dost cleanse thyself</l>
    <l>To return beautiful to Him who made thee,</l>
    <l>Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,&quot;</l>
    <l>He answered; &quot;and if smoke prevent our seeing,</l>
    <l>Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereon began I: &quot;With that swathing band</l>
    <l>Which death unwindeth am I going upward,</l>
    <l>And hither came I through the infernal anguish.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if God in his grace has me infolded,</l>
    <l>So that he wills that I behold his court</l>
    <l>By method wholly out of modern usage,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,</l>
    <l>But tell it me, and tell me if I go</l>
    <l>Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;</l>
    <l>The world I knew, and loved that excellence,</l>
    <l>At which has each one now unbent his bow.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For mounting upward, thou art going right.&quot;</l>
    <l>Thus he made answer, and subjoined: &quot;I pray thee</l>
    <l>To pray for me when thou shalt be above.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I to him: &quot;My faith I pledge to thee</l>
    <l>To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting</l>
    <l>Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>First it was simple, and is now made double</l>
    <l>By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,</l>
    <l>Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The world forsooth is utterly deserted</l>
    <l>By every virtue, as thou tellest me,</l>
    <l>And with iniquity is big and covered;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But I beseech thee point me out the cause,</l>
    <l>That I may see it, and to others show it;</l>
    <l>For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!</l>
    <l>He first sent forth, and then began he: &quot;Brother,</l>
    <l>The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ye who are living every cause refer</l>
    <l>Still upward to the heavens, as if all things</l>
    <l>They of necessity moved with themselves.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If this were so, in you would be destroyed</l>
    <l>Free will, nor any justice would there be</l>
    <l>In having joy for good, or grief for evil.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The heavens your movements do initiate,</l>
    <l>I say not all; but granting that I say it,</l>
    <l>Light has been given you for good and evil,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And free volition; which, if some fatigue</l>
    <l>In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,</l>
    <l>Afterwards conquers all, if well 'tis nurtured.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To greater force and to a better nature,</l>
    <l>Though free, ye subject are, and that creates</l>
    <l>The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence, if the present world doth go astray,</l>
    <l>In you the cause is, be it sought in you;</l>
    <l>And I therein will now be thy true spy.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it</l>
    <l>Before it is, like to a little girl</l>
    <l>Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows,</l>
    <l>Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker,</l>
    <l>Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Of trivial good at first it tastes the savour;</l>
    <l>Is cheated by it, and runs after it,</l>
    <l>If guide or rein turn not aside its love.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place,</l>
    <l>Behoved a king to have, who at the least</l>
    <l>Of the true city should discern the tower.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?</l>
    <l>No one; because the shepherd who precedes</l>
    <l>Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Wherefore the people that perceives its guide</l>
    <l>Strike only at the good for which it hankers,</l>
    <l>Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance</l>
    <l>The cause is that has made the world depraved,</l>
    <l>And not that nature is corrupt in you.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Rome, that reformed the world, accustomed was</l>
    <l>Two suns to have, which one road and the other,</l>
    <l>Of God and of the world, made manifest.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One has the other quenched, and to the crosier</l>
    <l>The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it</l>
    <l>That by main force one with the other go,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Because, being joined, one feareth not the other;</l>
    <l>If thou believe not, think upon the grain,</l>
    <l>For by its seed each herb is recognized.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In the land laved by Po and Adige,</l>
    <l>Valour and courtesy used to be found,</l>
    <l>Before that Frederick had his controversy;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now in security can pass that way</l>
    <l>Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame,</l>
    <l>From speaking with the good, or drawing near them.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>True, three old men are left, in whom upbraids</l>
    <l>The ancient age the new, and late they deem it</l>
    <l>That God restore them to the better life:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Currado da Palazzo, and good Gherardo,</l>
    <l>And Guido da Castel, who better named is,</l>
    <l>In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Say thou henceforward that the Church of Rome,</l>
    <l>Confounding in itself two governments,</l>
    <l>Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O Marco mine,&quot; I said, &quot;thou reasonest well;</l>
    <l>And now discern I why the sons of Levi</l>
    <l>Have been excluded from the heritage.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But what Gherardo is it, who, as sample</l>
    <l>Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained</l>
    <l>In reprobation of the barbarous age?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,&quot;</l>
    <l>He answered me; &quot;for speaking Tuscan to me,</l>
    <l>It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>By other surname do I know him not,</l>
    <l>Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia.</l>
    <l>May God be with you, for I come no farther.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Behold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out,</l>
    <l>Already whitening; and I must depart--</l>
    <l>Yonder the Angel is--ere he appear.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus did he speak, and would no farther hear me.</l>
