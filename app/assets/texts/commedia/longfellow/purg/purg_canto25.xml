  <p>
    <l>Now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked,</l>
    <l>Because the sun had his meridian circle</l>
    <l>To Taurus left, and night to Scorpio;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Wherefore as doth a man who tarries not,</l>
    <l>But goes his way, whate'er to him appear,</l>
    <l>If of necessity the sting transfix him,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In this wise did we enter through the gap,</l>
    <l>Taking the stairway, one before the other,</l>
    <l>Which by its narrowness divides the climbers.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as the little stork that lifts its wing</l>
    <l>With a desire to fly, and does not venture</l>
    <l>To leave the nest, and lets it downward droop,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even such was I, with the desire of asking</l>
    <l>Kindled and quenched, unto the motion coming</l>
    <l>He makes who doth address himself to speak.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not for our pace, though rapid it might be,</l>
    <l>My father sweet forbore, but said: &quot;Let fly</l>
    <l>The bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With confidence I opened then my mouth,</l>
    <l>And I began: &quot;How can one meagre grow</l>
    <l>There where the need of nutriment applies not?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;If thou wouldst call to mind how Meleager</l>
    <l>Was wasted by the wasting of a brand,</l>
    <l>This would not,&quot; said he, &quot;be to thee so sour;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion</l>
    <l>Trembles within a mirror your own image;</l>
    <l>That which seems hard would mellow seem to thee.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But that thou mayst content thee in thy wish</l>
    <l>Lo Statius here; and him I call and pray</l>
    <l>He now will be the healer of thy wounds.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;If I unfold to him the eternal vengeance,&quot;</l>
    <l>Responded Statius, &quot;where thou present art,</l>
    <l>Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then he began: &quot;Son, if these words of mine</l>
    <l>Thy mind doth contemplate and doth receive,</l>
    <l>They'll be thy light unto the How thou sayest.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The perfect blood, which never is drunk up</l>
    <l>Into the thirsty veins, and which remaineth</l>
    <l>Like food that from the table thou removest,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Takes in the heart for all the human members</l>
    <l>Virtue informative, as being that</l>
    <l>Which to be changed to them goes through the veins</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Again digest, descends it where 'tis better</l>
    <l>Silent to be than say; and then drops thence</l>
    <l>Upon another's blood in natural vase.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There one together with the other mingles,</l>
    <l>One to be passive meant, the other active</l>
    <l>By reason of the perfect place it springs from;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And being conjoined, begins to operate,</l>
    <l>Coagulating first, then vivifying</l>
    <l>What for its matter it had made consistent.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The active virtue, being made a soul</l>
    <l>As of a plant, (in so far different,</l>
    <l>This on the way is, that arrived already,)</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then works so much, that now it moves and feels</l>
    <l>Like a sea-fungus, and then undertakes</l>
    <l>To organize the powers whose seed it is.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now, Son, dilates and now distends itself</l>
    <l>The virtue from the generator's heart,</l>
    <l>Where nature is intent on all the members.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But how from animal it man becomes</l>
    <l>Thou dost not see as yet; this is a point</l>
    <l>Which made a wiser man than thou once err</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So far, that in his doctrine separate</l>
    <l>He made the soul from possible intellect,</l>
    <l>For he no organ saw by this assumed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Open thy breast unto the truth that's coming,</l>
    <l>And know that, just as soon as in the foetus</l>
    <l>The articulation of the brain is perfect,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The primal Motor turns to it well pleased</l>
    <l>At so great art of nature, and inspires</l>
    <l>A spirit new with virtue all replete,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Which what it finds there active doth attract</l>
    <l>Into its substance, and becomes one soul,</l>
    <l>Which lives, and feels, and on itself revolves.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And that thou less may wonder at my word,</l>
    <l>Behold the sun's heat, which becometh wine,</l>
    <l>Joined to the juice that from the vine distils.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whenever Lachesis has no more thread,</l>
    <l>It separates from the flesh, and virtually</l>
    <l>Bears with itself the human and divine;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The other faculties are voiceless all;</l>
    <l>The memory, the intelligence, and the will</l>
    <l>In action far more vigorous than before.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Without a pause it falleth of itself</l>
    <l>In marvellous way on one shore or the other;</l>
    <l>There of its roads it first is cognizant.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Soon as the place there circumscribeth it,</l>
    <l>The virtue informative rays round about,</l>
    <l>As, and as much as, in the living members.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And even as the air, when full of rain,</l>
    <l>By alien rays that are therein reflected,</l>
    <l>With divers colours shows itself adorned,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So there the neighbouring air doth shape itself</l>
    <l>Into that form which doth impress upon it</l>
    <l>Virtually the soul that has stood still.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And then in manner of the little flame,</l>
    <l>Which followeth the fire where'er it shifts,</l>
    <l>After the spirit followeth its new form.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Since afterwards it takes from this its semblance,</l>
    <l>It is called shade; and thence it organizes</l>
    <l>Thereafter every sense, even to the sight.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thence is it that we speak, and thence we laugh;</l>
    <l>Thence is it that we form the tears and sighs,</l>
    <l>That on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>According as impress us our desires</l>
    <l>And other affections, so the shade is shaped,</l>
    <l>And this is cause of what thou wonderest at.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And now unto the last of all the circles</l>
    <l>Had we arrived, and to the right hand turned,</l>
    <l>And were attentive to another care.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There the embankment shoots forth flames of fire,</l>
    <l>And upward doth the cornice breathe a blast</l>
    <l>That drives them back, and from itself sequesters.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Hence we must needs go on the open side,</l>
    <l>And one by one; and I did fear the fire</l>
    <l>On this side, and on that the falling down.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>My Leader said: &quot;Along this place one ought</l>
    <l>To keep upon the eyes a tightened rein,</l>
    <l>Seeing that one so easily might err.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Summae Deus clementiae,&quot; in the bosom</l>
    <l>Of the great burning chanted then I heard,</l>
    <l>Which made me no less eager to turn round;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And spirits saw I walking through the flame;</l>
    <l>Wherefore I looked, to my own steps and theirs</l>
    <l>Apportioning my sight from time to time.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After the close which to that hymn is made,</l>
    <l>Aloud they shouted, &quot;Virum non cognosco;&quot;</l>
    <l>Then recommenced the hymn with voices low.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This also ended, cried they: &quot;To the wood</l>
    <l>Diana ran, and drove forth Helice</l>
    <l>Therefrom, who had of Venus felt the poison.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then to their song returned they; then the wives</l>
    <l>They shouted, and the husbands who were chaste.</l>
    <l>As virtue and the marriage vow imposes.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I believe that them this mode suffices,</l>
    <l>For all the time the fire is burning them;</l>
    <l>With such care is it needful, and such food,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That the last wound of all should be closed up.</l>
