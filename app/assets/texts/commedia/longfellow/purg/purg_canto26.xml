  <p>
    <l>While on the brink thus one before the other</l>
    <l>We went upon our way, oft the good Master</l>
    <l>Said: &quot;Take thou heed! suffice it that I warn thee.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On the right shoulder smote me now the sun,</l>
    <l>That, raying out, already the whole west</l>
    <l>Changed from its azure aspect into white.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And with my shadow did I make the flame</l>
    <l>Appear more red; and even to such a sign</l>
    <l>Shades saw I many, as they went, give heed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This was the cause that gave them a beginning</l>
    <l>To speak of me; and to themselves began they</l>
    <l>To say: &quot;That seems not a factitious body!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then towards me, as far as they could come,</l>
    <l>Came certain of them, always with regard</l>
    <l>Not to step forth where they would not be burned.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O thou who goest, not from being slower</l>
    <l>But reverent perhaps, behind the others,</l>
    <l>Answer me, who in thirst and fire am burning.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Nor to me only is thine answer needful;</l>
    <l>For all of these have greater thirst for it</l>
    <l>Than for cold water Ethiop or Indian.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Tell us how is it that thou makest thyself</l>
    <l>A wall unto the sun, as if thou hadst not</l>
    <l>Entered as yet into the net of death.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus one of them addressed me, and I straight</l>
    <l>Should have revealed myself, were I not bent</l>
    <l>On other novelty that then appeared.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For through the middle of the burning road</l>
    <l>There came a people face to face with these,</l>
    <l>Which held me in suspense with gazing at them.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>There see I hastening upon either side</l>
    <l>Each of the shades, and kissing one another</l>
    <l>Without a pause, content with brief salute.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus in the middle of their brown battalions</l>
    <l>Muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another</l>
    <l>Perchance to spy their journey or their fortune.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>No sooner is the friendly greeting ended,</l>
    <l>Or ever the first footstep passes onward,</l>
    <l>Each one endeavours to outcry the other;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The new-come people: &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah!&quot;</l>
    <l>The rest: &quot;Into the cow Pasiphae enters,</l>
    <l>So that the bull unto her lust may run!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then as the cranes, that to Riphaean mountains</l>
    <l>Might fly in part, and part towards the sands,</l>
    <l>These of the frost, those of the sun avoidant,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>One folk is going, and the other coming,</l>
    <l>And weeping they return to their first songs,</l>
    <l>And to the cry that most befitteth them;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And close to me approached, even as before,</l>
    <l>The very same who had entreated me,</l>
    <l>Attent to listen in their countenance.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I, who their inclination twice had seen,</l>
    <l>Began: &quot;O souls secure in the possession,</l>
    <l>Whene'er it may be, of a state of peace,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Neither unripe nor ripened have remained</l>
    <l>My members upon earth, but here are with me</l>
    <l>With their own blood and their articulations.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I go up here to be no longer blind;</l>
    <l>A Lady is above, who wins this grace,</l>
    <l>Whereby the mortal through your world I bring.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But as your greatest longing satisfied</l>
    <l>May soon become, so that the Heaven may house you</l>
    <l>Which full of love is, and most amply spreads,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Tell me, that I again in books may write it,</l>
    <l>Who are you, and what is that multitude</l>
    <l>Which goes upon its way behind your backs?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Not otherwise with wonder is bewildered</l>
    <l>The mountaineer, and staring round is dumb,</l>
    <l>When rough and rustic to the town he goes,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Than every shade became in its appearance;</l>
    <l>But when they of their stupor were disburdened,</l>
    <l>Which in high hearts is quickly quieted,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Blessed be thou, who of our border-lands,&quot;</l>
    <l>He recommenced who first had questioned us,</l>
    <l>&quot;Experience freightest for a better life.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The folk that comes not with us have offended</l>
    <l>In that for which once Caesar, triumphing,</l>
    <l>Heard himself called in contumely, 'Queen.'</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore they separate, exclaiming, 'Sodom!'</l>
    <l>Themselves reproving, even as thou hast heard,</l>
    <l>And add unto their burning by their shame.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Our own transgression was hermaphrodite;</l>
    <l>But because we observed not human law,</l>
    <l>Following like unto beasts our appetite,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In our opprobrium by us is read,</l>
    <l>When we part company, the name of her</l>
    <l>Who bestialized herself in bestial wood.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now knowest thou our acts, and what our crime was;</l>
    <l>Wouldst thou perchance by name know who we are,</l>
    <l>There is not time to tell, nor could I do it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thy wish to know me shall in sooth be granted;</l>
    <l>I'm Guido Guinicelli, and now purge me,</l>
    <l>Having repented ere the hour extreme.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The same that in the sadness of Lycurgus</l>
    <l>Two sons became, their mother re-beholding,</l>
    <l>Such I became, but rise not to such height,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The moment I heard name himself the father</l>
    <l>Of me and of my betters, who had ever</l>
    <l>Practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And without speech and hearing thoughtfully</l>
    <l>For a long time I went, beholding him,</l>
    <l>Nor for the fire did I approach him nearer.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When I was fed with looking, utterly</l>
    <l>Myself I offered ready for his service,</l>
    <l>With affirmation that compels belief.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he to me: &quot;Thou leavest footprints such</l>
    <l>In me, from what I hear, and so distinct,</l>
    <l>Lethe cannot efface them, nor make dim.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But if thy words just now the truth have sworn,</l>
    <l>Tell me what is the cause why thou displayest</l>
    <l>In word and look that dear thou holdest me?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I to him: &quot;Those dulcet lays of yours</l>
    <l>Which, long as shall endure our modern fashion,</l>
    <l>Shall make for ever dear their very ink!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O brother,&quot; said he, &quot;he whom I point out,&quot;</l>
    <l>And here he pointed at a spirit in front,</l>
    <l>&quot;Was of the mother tongue a better smith.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Verses of love and proses of romance,</l>
    <l>He mastered all; and let the idiots talk,</l>
    <l>Who think the Lemosin surpasses him.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To clamour more than truth they turn their faces,</l>
    <l>And in this way establish their opinion,</l>
    <l>Ere art or reason has by them been heard.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus many ancients with Guittone did,</l>
    <l>From cry to cry still giving him applause,</l>
    <l>Until the truth has conquered with most persons.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now, if thou hast such ample privilege</l>
    <l>'Tis granted thee to go unto the cloister</l>
    <l>Wherein is Christ the abbot of the college,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>To him repeat for me a Paternoster,</l>
    <l>So far as needful to us of this world,</l>
    <l>Where power of sinning is no longer ours.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then, to give place perchance to one behind,</l>
    <l>Whom he had near, he vanished in the fire</l>
    <l>As fish in water going to the bottom.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I moved a little tow'rds him pointed out,</l>
    <l>And said that to his name my own desire</l>
    <l>An honourable place was making ready.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>He of his own free will began to say:</l>
    <l>'Tan m' abellis vostre cortes deman,</l>
    <l>Que jeu nom' puesc ni vueill a vos cobrire;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Jeu sui Arnaut, que plor e vai chantan;</l>
    <l>Consiros vei la passada folor,</l>
    <l>E vei jauzen lo jorn qu' esper denan.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Ara vus prec per aquella valor,</l>
    <l>Que vus condus al som de la scalina,</l>
    <l>Sovenga vus a temprar ma dolor.'*</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then hid him in the fire that purifies them.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>* So pleases me your courteous demand,</l>
    <l>I cannot and I will not hide me from you.</l>
    <l>I am Arnaut, who weep and singing go;</l>
    <l>Contrite I see the folly of the past,</l>
    <l>And joyous see the hoped-for day before me.</l>
    <l>Therefore do I implore you, by that power</l>
    <l>Which guides you to the summit of the stairs,</l>
    <l>Be mindful to assuage my suffering!</l>
