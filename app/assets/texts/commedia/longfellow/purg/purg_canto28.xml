  <p>
    <l>Eager already to search in and round</l>
    <l>The heavenly forest, dense and living-green,</l>
    <l>Which tempered to the eyes the new-born day,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Withouten more delay I left the bank,</l>
    <l>Taking the level country slowly, slowly</l>
    <l>Over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A softly-breathing air, that no mutation</l>
    <l>Had in itself, upon the forehead smote me</l>
    <l>No heavier blow than of a gentle wind,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whereat the branches, lightly tremulous,</l>
    <l>Did all of them bow downward toward that side</l>
    <l>Where its first shadow casts the Holy Mountain;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Yet not from their upright direction swayed,</l>
    <l>So that the little birds upon their tops</l>
    <l>Should leave the practice of each art of theirs;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But with full ravishment the hours of prime,</l>
    <l>Singing, received they in the midst of leaves,</l>
    <l>That ever bore a burden to their rhymes,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Such as from branch to branch goes gathering on</l>
    <l>Through the pine forest on the shore of Chiassi,</l>
    <l>When Eolus unlooses the Sirocco.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Already my slow steps had carried me</l>
    <l>Into the ancient wood so far, that I</l>
    <l>Could not perceive where I had entered it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And lo! my further course a stream cut off,</l>
    <l>Which tow'rd the left hand with its little waves</l>
    <l>Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>All waters that on earth most limpid are</l>
    <l>Would seem to have within themselves some mixture</l>
    <l>Compared with that which nothing doth conceal,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Although it moves on with a brown, brown current</l>
    <l>Under the shade perpetual, that never</l>
    <l>Ray of the sun lets in, nor of the moon.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>With feet I stayed, and with mine eyes I passed</l>
    <l>Beyond the rivulet, to look upon</l>
    <l>The great variety of the fresh may.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And there appeared to me (even as appears</l>
    <l>Suddenly something that doth turn aside</l>
    <l>Through very wonder every other thought)</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A lady all alone, who went along</l>
    <l>Singing and culling floweret after floweret,</l>
    <l>With which her pathway was all painted over.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Ah, beauteous lady, who in rays of love</l>
    <l>Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks,</l>
    <l>Which the heart's witnesses are wont to be,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>May the desire come unto thee to draw</l>
    <l>Near to this river's bank,&quot; I said to her,</l>
    <l>&quot;So much that I might hear what thou art singing.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou makest me remember where and what</l>
    <l>Proserpina that moment was when lost</l>
    <l>Her mother her, and she herself the Spring.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As turns herself, with feet together pressed</l>
    <l>And to the ground, a lady who is dancing,</l>
    <l>And hardly puts one foot before the other,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>On the vermilion and the yellow flowerets</l>
    <l>She turned towards me, not in other wise</l>
    <l>Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And my entreaties made to be content,</l>
    <l>So near approaching, that the dulcet sound</l>
    <l>Came unto me together with its meaning</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As soon as she was where the grasses are.</l>
    <l>Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,</l>
    <l>To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I do not think there shone so great a light</l>
    <l>Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed</l>
    <l>By her own son, beyond his usual custom!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Erect upon the other bank she smiled,</l>
    <l>Bearing full many colours in her hands,</l>
    <l>Which that high land produces without seed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Apart three paces did the river make us;</l>
    <l>But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across,</l>
    <l>(A curb still to all human arrogance,)</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>More hatred from Leander did not suffer</l>
    <l>For rolling between Sestos and Abydos,</l>
    <l>Than that from me, because it oped not then.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Ye are new-comers; and because I smile,&quot;</l>
    <l>Began she, &quot;peradventure, in this place</l>
    <l>Elect to human nature for its nest,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Some apprehension keeps you marvelling;</l>
    <l>But the psalm 'Delectasti' giveth light</l>
    <l>Which has the power to uncloud your intellect.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And thou who foremost art, and didst entreat me,</l>
    <l>Speak, if thou wouldst hear more; for I came ready</l>
    <l>To all thy questionings, as far as needful.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;The water,&quot; said I, &quot;and the forest's sound,</l>
    <l>Are combating within me my new faith</l>
    <l>In something which I heard opposed to this.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence she: &quot;I will relate how from its cause</l>
    <l>Proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder,</l>
    <l>And purge away the cloud that smites upon thee.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The Good Supreme, sole in itself delighting,</l>
    <l>Created man good, and this goodly place</l>
    <l>Gave him as hansel of eternal peace.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>By his default short while he sojourned here;</l>
    <l>By his default to weeping and to toil</l>
    <l>He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That the disturbance which below is made</l>
    <l>By exhalations of the land and water,</l>
    <l>(Which far as may be follow after heat,)</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Might not upon mankind wage any war,</l>
    <l>This mount ascended tow'rds the heaven so high,</l>
    <l>And is exempt, from there where it is locked.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Now since the universal atmosphere</l>
    <l>Turns in a circuit with the primal motion</l>
    <l>Unless the circle is broken on some side,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon this height, that all is disengaged</l>
    <l>In living ether, doth this motion strike</l>
    <l>And make the forest sound, for it is dense;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And so much power the stricken plant possesses</l>
    <l>That with its virtue it impregns the air,</l>
    <l>And this, revolving, scatters it around;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And yonder earth, according as 'tis worthy</l>
    <l>In self or in its clime, conceives and bears</l>
    <l>Of divers qualities the divers trees;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It should not seem a marvel then on earth,</l>
    <l>This being heard, whenever any plant</l>
    <l>Without seed manifest there taketh root.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And thou must know, this holy table-land</l>
    <l>In which thou art is full of every seed,</l>
    <l>And fruit has in it never gathered there.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The water which thou seest springs not from vein</l>
    <l>Restored by vapour that the cold condenses,</l>
    <l>Like to a stream that gains or loses breath;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But issues from a fountain safe and certain,</l>
    <l>Which by the will of God as much regains</l>
    <l>As it discharges, open on two sides.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Upon this side with virtue it descends,</l>
    <l>Which takes away all memory of sin;</l>
    <l>On that, of every good deed done restores it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Here Lethe, as upon the other side</l>
    <l>Eunoe, it is called; and worketh not</l>
    <l>If first on either side it be not tasted.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>This every other savour doth transcend;</l>
    <l>And notwithstanding slaked so far may be</l>
    <l>Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I'll give thee a corollary still in grace,</l>
    <l>Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear</l>
    <l>If it spread out beyond my promise to thee.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Those who in ancient times have feigned in song</l>
    <l>The Age of Gold and its felicity,</l>
    <l>Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Here was the human race in innocence;</l>
    <l>Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit;</l>
    <l>This is the nectar of which each one speaks.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then backward did I turn me wholly round</l>
    <l>Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile</l>
    <l>They had been listening to these closing words;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes.</l>
