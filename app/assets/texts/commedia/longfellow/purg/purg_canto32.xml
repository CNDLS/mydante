  <p>
    <l>So steadfast and attentive were mine eyes</l>
    <l>In satisfying their decennial thirst,</l>
    <l>That all my other senses were extinct,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And upon this side and on that they had</l>
    <l>Walls of indifference, so the holy smile</l>
    <l>Drew them unto itself with the old net</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When forcibly my sight was turned away</l>
    <l>Towards my left hand by those goddesses,</l>
    <l>Because I heard from them a &quot;Too intently!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And that condition of the sight which is</l>
    <l>In eyes but lately smitten by the sun</l>
    <l>Bereft me of my vision some short while;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But to the less when sight re-shaped itself,</l>
    <l>I say the less in reference to the greater</l>
    <l>Splendour from which perforce I had withdrawn,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I saw upon its right wing wheeled about</l>
    <l>The glorious host returning with the sun</l>
    <l>And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As underneath its shields, to save itself,</l>
    <l>A squadron turns, and with its banner wheels,</l>
    <l>Before the whole thereof can change its front,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That soldiery of the celestial kingdom</l>
    <l>Which marched in the advance had wholly passed us</l>
    <l>Before the chariot had turned its pole.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves,</l>
    <l>And the Griffin moved his burden benedight,</l>
    <l>But so that not a feather of him fluttered.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The lady fair who drew me through the ford</l>
    <l>Followed with Statius and myself the wheel</l>
    <l>Which made its orbit with the lesser arc.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So passing through the lofty forest, vacant</l>
    <l>By fault of her who in the serpent trusted,</l>
    <l>Angelic music made our steps keep time.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Perchance as great a space had in three flights</l>
    <l>An arrow loosened from the string o'erpassed,</l>
    <l>As we had moved when Beatrice descended.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I heard them murmur altogether, &quot;Adam!&quot;</l>
    <l>Then circled they about a tree despoiled</l>
    <l>Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Its tresses, which so much the more dilate</l>
    <l>As higher they ascend, had been by Indians</l>
    <l>Among their forests marvelled at for height.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not</l>
    <l>Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste,</l>
    <l>Since appetite by this was turned to evil.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>After this fashion round the tree robust</l>
    <l>The others shouted; and the twofold creature:</l>
    <l>&quot;Thus is preserved the seed of all the just.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And turning to the pole which he had dragged,</l>
    <l>He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,</l>
    <l>And what was of it unto it left bound.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In the same manner as our trees (when downward</l>
    <l>Falls the great light, with that together mingled</l>
    <l>Which after the celestial Lasca shines)</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Begin to swell, and then renew themselves,</l>
    <l>Each one with its own colour, ere the Sun</l>
    <l>Harness his steeds beneath another star:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Less than of rose and more than violet</l>
    <l>A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree</l>
    <l>That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I never heard, nor here below is sung,</l>
    <l>The hymn which afterward that people sang,</l>
    <l>Nor did I bear the melody throughout.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Had I the power to paint how fell asleep</l>
    <l>Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,</l>
    <l>Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even as a painter who from model paints</l>
    <l>I would portray how I was lulled asleep;</l>
    <l>He may, who well can picture drowsihood.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore I pass to what time I awoke,</l>
    <l>And say a splendour rent from me the veil</l>
    <l>Of slumber, and a calling: &quot;Rise, what dost thou?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As to behold the apple-tree in blossom</l>
    <l>Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,</l>
    <l>And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Peter and John and James conducted were,</l>
    <l>And, overcome, recovered at the word</l>
    <l>By which still greater slumbers have been broken,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And saw their school diminished by the loss</l>
    <l>Not only of Elias, but of Moses,</l>
    <l>And the apparel of their Master changed;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So I revived, and saw that piteous one</l>
    <l>Above me standing, who had been conductress</l>
    <l>Aforetime of my steps beside the river,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And all in doubt I said, &quot;Where's Beatrice?&quot;</l>
    <l>And she: &quot;Behold her seated underneath</l>
    <l>The leafage new, upon the root of it.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Behold the company that circles her;</l>
    <l>The rest behind the Griffin are ascending</l>
    <l>With more melodious song, and more profound.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,</l>
    <l>Because already in my sight was she</l>
    <l>Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Alone she sat upon the very earth,</l>
    <l>Left there as guardian of the chariot</l>
    <l>Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Encircling her, a cloister made themselves</l>
    <l>The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands</l>
    <l>Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;Short while shalt thou be here a forester,</l>
    <l>And thou shalt be with me for evermore</l>
    <l>A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Therefore, for that world's good which liveth ill,</l>
    <l>Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,</l>
    <l>Having returned to earth, take heed thou write.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet</l>
    <l>Of her commandments all devoted was,</l>
    <l>My mind and eyes directed where she willed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Never descended with so swift a motion</l>
    <l>Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining</l>
    <l>From out the region which is most remote,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As I beheld the bird of Jove descend</l>
    <l>Down through the tree, rending away the bark,</l>
    <l>As well as blossoms and the foliage new,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And he with all his might the chariot smote,</l>
    <l>Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest</l>
    <l>Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thereafter saw I leap into the body</l>
    <l>Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,</l>
    <l>That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,</l>
    <l>My Lady put him to as swift a flight</l>
    <l>As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then by the way that it before had come,</l>
    <l>Into the chariot's chest I saw the Eagle</l>
    <l>Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And such as issues from a heart that mourns,</l>
    <l>A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:</l>
    <l>&quot;My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between</l>
    <l>Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,</l>
    <l>Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,</l>
    <l>Drawing unto himself his tail malign,</l>
    <l>Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>That which remained behind, even as with grass</l>
    <l>A fertile region, with the feathers, offered</l>
    <l>Perhaps with pure intention and benign,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed</l>
    <l>The pole and both the wheels so speedily,</l>
    <l>A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Transfigured thus the holy edifice</l>
    <l>Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,</l>
    <l>Three on the pole and one at either corner.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The first were horned like oxen; but the four</l>
    <l>Had but a single horn upon the forehead;</l>
    <l>A monster such had never yet been seen!</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,</l>
    <l>Seated upon it, there appeared to me</l>
    <l>A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And, as if not to have her taken from him,</l>
    <l>Upright beside her I beheld a giant;</l>
    <l>And ever and anon they kissed each other.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But because she her wanton, roving eye</l>
    <l>Turned upon me, her angry paramour</l>
    <l>Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,</l>
    <l>He loosed the monster, and across the forest</l>
    <l>Dragged it so far, he made of that alone</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>A shield unto the whore and the strange beast.</l>
