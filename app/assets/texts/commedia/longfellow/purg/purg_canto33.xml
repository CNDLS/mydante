    <l>&quot;Deus venerunt gentes,&quot; alternating</l>
    <l>Now three, now four, melodious psalmody</l>
    <l>The maidens in the midst of tears began;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,</l>
    <l>Listened to them with such a countenance,</l>
    <l>That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But when the other virgins place had given</l>
    <l>For her to speak, uprisen to her feet</l>
    <l>With colour as of fire, she made response:</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;'Modicum, et non videbitis me;</l>
    <l>Et iterum,' my sisters predilect,</l>
    <l>'Modicum, et vos videbitis me.'&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Then all the seven in front of her she placed;</l>
    <l>And after her, by beckoning only, moved</l>
    <l>Me and the lady and the sage who stayed.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>So she moved onward; and I do not think</l>
    <l>That her tenth step was placed upon the ground,</l>
    <l>When with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And with a tranquil aspect, &quot;Come more quickly,&quot;</l>
    <l>To me she said, &quot;that, if I speak with thee,</l>
    <l>To listen to me thou mayst be well placed.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As soon as I was with her as I should be,</l>
    <l>She said to me: &quot;Why, brother, dost thou not</l>
    <l>Venture to question now, in coming with me?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>As unto those who are too reverential,</l>
    <l>Speaking in presence of superiors,</l>
    <l>Who drag no living utterance to their teeth,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>It me befell, that without perfect sound</l>
    <l>Began I: &quot;My necessity, Madonna,</l>
    <l>You know, and that which thereunto is good.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And she to me: &quot;Of fear and bashfulness</l>
    <l>Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself,</l>
    <l>So that thou speak no more as one who dreams.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Know that the vessel which the serpent broke</l>
    <l>Was, and is not; but let him who is guilty</l>
    <l>Think that God's vengeance does not fear a sop.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Without an heir shall not for ever be</l>
    <l>The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car,</l>
    <l>Whence it became a monster, then a prey;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For verily I see, and hence narrate it,</l>
    <l>The stars already near to bring the time,</l>
    <l>From every hindrance safe, and every bar,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Within which a Five-hundred, Ten, and Five,</l>
    <l>One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman</l>
    <l>And that same giant who is sinning with her.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And peradventure my dark utterance,</l>
    <l>Like Themis and the Sphinx, may less persuade thee,</l>
    <l>Since, in their mode, it clouds the intellect;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But soon the facts shall be the Naiades</l>
    <l>Who shall this difficult enigma solve,</l>
    <l>Without destruction of the flocks and harvests.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Note thou; and even as by me are uttered</l>
    <l>These words, so teach them unto those who live</l>
    <l>That life which is a running unto death;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And bear in mind, whene'er thou writest them,</l>
    <l>Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant,</l>
    <l>That twice already has been pillaged here.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whoever pillages or shatters it,</l>
    <l>With blasphemy of deed offendeth God,</l>
    <l>Who made it holy for his use alone.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For biting that, in pain and in desire</l>
    <l>Five thousand years and more the first-born soul</l>
    <l>Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thy genius slumbers, if it deem it not</l>
    <l>For special reason so pre-eminent</l>
    <l>In height, and so inverted in its summit.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if thy vain imaginings had not been</l>
    <l>Water of Elsa round about thy mind,</l>
    <l>And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Thou by so many circumstances only</l>
    <l>The justice of the interdict of God</l>
    <l>Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But since I see thee in thine intellect</l>
    <l>Converted into stone and stained with sin,</l>
    <l>So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>I will too, if not written, at least painted,</l>
    <l>Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason</l>
    <l>That cinct with palm the pilgrim's staff is borne.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And I: &quot;As by a signet is the wax</l>
    <l>Which does not change the figure stamped upon it,</l>
    <l>My brain is now imprinted by yourself.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But wherefore so beyond my power of sight</l>
    <l>Soars your desirable discourse, that aye</l>
    <l>The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;That thou mayst recognize,&quot; she said, &quot;the school</l>
    <l>Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far</l>
    <l>Its doctrine follows after my discourse,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And mayst behold your path from the divine</l>
    <l>Distant as far as separated is</l>
    <l>From earth the heaven that highest hastens on.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Whence her I answered: &quot;I do not remember</l>
    <l>That ever I estranged myself from you,</l>
    <l>Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;And if thou art not able to remember,&quot;</l>
    <l>Smiling she answered, &quot;recollect thee now</l>
    <l>That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And if from smoke a fire may be inferred,</l>
    <l>Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates</l>
    <l>Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Truly from this time forward shall my words</l>
    <l>Be naked, so far as it is befitting</l>
    <l>To lay them open unto thy rude gaze.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And more coruscant and with slower steps</l>
    <l>The sun was holding the meridian circle,</l>
    <l>Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>When halted (as he cometh to a halt,</l>
    <l>Who goes before a squadron as its escort,</l>
    <l>If something new he find upon his way)</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The ladies seven at a dark shadow's edge,</l>
    <l>Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black,</l>
    <l>The Alp upon its frigid border wears.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates</l>
    <l>Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain,</l>
    <l>And slowly part, like friends, from one another.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>&quot;O light, O glory of the human race!</l>
    <l>What stream is this which here unfolds itself</l>
    <l>From out one source, and from itself withdraws?&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>For such a prayer, 'twas said unto me, &quot;Pray</l>
    <l>Matilda that she tell thee;&quot; and here answered,</l>
    <l>As one does who doth free himself from blame,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>The beautiful lady: &quot;This and other things</l>
    <l>Were told to him by me; and sure I am</l>
    <l>The water of Lethe has not hid them from him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>And Beatrice: &quot;Perhaps a greater care,</l>
    <l>Which oftentimes our memory takes away,</l>
    <l>Has made the vision of his mind obscure.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But Eunoe behold, that yonder rises;</l>
    <l>Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed,</l>
    <l>Revive again the half-dead virtue in him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Like gentle soul, that maketh no excuse,</l>
    <l>But makes its own will of another's will</l>
    <l>As soon as by a sign it is disclosed,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Even so, when she had taken hold of me,</l>
    <l>The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius</l>
    <l>Said, in her womanly manner, &quot;Come with him.&quot;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>If, Reader, I possessed a longer space</l>
    <l>For writing it, I yet would sing in part</l>
    <l>Of the sweet draught that ne'er would satiate me;</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>But inasmuch as full are all the leaves</l>
    <l>Made ready for this second canticle,</l>
    <l>The curb of art no farther lets me go.</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>From the most holy water I returned</l>
    <l>Regenerate, in the manner of new trees</l>
    <l>That are renewed with a new foliage,</l>
  </p>
  <p>
    <l>Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars.</l>
